# What is WordPress ?
1. [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/) is a free and open-source web content management software (CMS) that can be downloaded and installed on one’s own server.
2. Because WordPress is written in [PHP](https://www.php.net/manual/en/intro-whatis.php) and requires a [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/what-is-mysql.html) or compatible database for storing content and settings, it also requires a web server to handle HTTP requests and serve web pages. WordPress is compatible with most web servers, including the [Apache Web Server](https://httpd.apache.org/), [NGINX](https://nginx.org/en/), and [Microsoft IIS.](https://www.iis.net/)
