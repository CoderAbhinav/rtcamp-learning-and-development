## Development Plan: To-Do App with Local Storage (12 hours)

This plan outlines the development process for a basic React application functioning as a to-do list manager with local storage for data persistence. The estimated time for completion is 12 hours, divided into stages with corresponding commits.

**Tools and Technologies:**

- React
- Local Storage API

**Stages and Commits:**

**Stage 1: Project Setup (2 hours)**

- **Commit 1: Project Initialization**
    - Create a new React project usingÂ `create-react-app`.
    - Configure ESLint and Prettier for code style enforcement.
    - Install any additional dependencies needed (e.g., for local storage interaction).
- **Commit 2: Folder Structure**
    - Create a basic folder structure for components, styles, and utilities.

**Stage 2: Component Development (4 hours)**

- **Commit 3: To-Do List Component**
    - Develop a functional component representing the entire to-do list application.
    - This component will manage state for the list of tasks and any UI elements.
- **Commit 4: Task Item Component**
    - Develop a reusable component for each individual task item.
    - This component will display the task description, completion status, and buttons for actions.
- **Commit 5: Add Task Component**
    - Develop a component for adding new tasks.
    - This component will include an input field for task description and a button to submit.

**Stage 3: Functionality Implementation (3 hours)**

- **Commit 6: Add Task Functionality**
    - Implement functionality to add new tasks to the internal state of the application.
    - Handle user input from the Add Task component and update the list accordingly.
- **Commit 7: Remove Task Functionality**
    - Implement functionality to remove tasks from the list.
    - Include confirmation prompts before deletion and update the state on removal.
- **Commit 8: Mark Task as Done**
    - Implement functionality to mark tasks as completed/pending.
    - Update the state to reflect the completion status and visually represent it in the UI.

**Stage 4: Local Storage Integration (2 hours)**

- **Commit 9: Local Storage Setup**
    - Implement logic to utilize the Local Storage API for data persistence.
    - Store the list of tasks in local storage on changes.
- **Commit 10: Load Data from Local Storage**
    - Implement logic to retrieve the list of tasks from local storage on application load.
    - Pre-populate the state with data from storage for continuity.

**Stage 5: UI Refinement and Testing (1 hour)**

- **Commit 11: UI Styling**
    - Apply basic styling to the application components using CSS or a styling library.
    - Improve the visual representation of tasks and UI elements.
- **Commit 12: Testing and Deployment**
    - Implement basic unit tests for core functionalities of the application.
    - Build the application for deployment and test its functionality thoroughly.

**Note:**

- This is a high-level plan, and the estimated time for each stage can vary depending on your development experience and complexity of implementation.
- Additional features like filtering tasks by completion status or editing task descriptions can be added in further stages if time allows.

This plan provides a roadmap for creating your to-do application with local storage using React. Remember to commit your code regularly and push it to a version control system for tracking changes.
