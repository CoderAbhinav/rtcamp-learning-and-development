            h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 {

                text-transform: lowercase;
            }

            /* b) On mobile devices, change paragraph font size to 12px */
            @media (max-width: 480px) {
                p {
                    font-size: 12px;
                }
            }

            /*  Anchors with dotted underline on hover */
            a:hover {
                text-decoration: underline dotted;
            }
    ```
