# FSE : 13th May 2024Â #209
## 1. How do you manage and organize reusable components or templates within an FSE environment?
1. **Template Parts**: Break down common sections of your site into template parts that can be reused across multiple templates.
2. **Block Patterns**: Create custom block patterns for frequently used layouts or designs.
3. **Global Styles**: Utilize global styles to define site-wide design settings and ensure consistency across templates.

## 2. How do you ensure responsiveness and compatibility with different devices and screen sizes when using FSE?
To ensure responsiveness and compatibility with different devices and screen sizes when using FSE, consider the following practices:
1. **Responsive Design**: Use CSS media queries to adjust layout and styling based on the viewport size.
2. **Viewport Meta Tag**: Include a viewport meta tag in your theme's HTML to ensure proper scaling on mobile devices.
3. **Flexible Layouts**: Design flexible layouts that adapt to various screen sizes without sacrificing usability or readability.
4. Configure responsive breakpoints and device-specific styles in `theme.json` to ensure that templates adapt to different screen sizes.

```json
// theme.json
{
  "settings": {
    "responsive": {
      "breakpoints": {
        "sm": "576px",
        "md": "768px",
        "lg": "992px",
        "xl": "1200px"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## 3. How do you handle versioning and rollback procedures when making changes to FSE templates or styles?
Versioning and rollback procedures when making changes to FSE templates or styles can be handled using version control systems (e.g., Git) and staging environments:
1. **Version Control**: Use Git or other version control systems to track changes to your theme files and templates.
2. **Staging Environment**: Set up a staging environment where you can test changes before deploying them to production.
3. **Rollback Strategy**: Have a rollback strategy in place in case of unforeseen issues or errors, such as reverting to a previous commit or backup.
4. **Theme.json Export:**
	1. WordPress offers a built-in option to export the theme with customizations. This creates a new theme.json file reflecting the FSE edits.
	2. You'll need to compare this exported file with your original theme.json to identify changes and commit those to your version control.
## 4. How do you approach the integration of custom functionality or plugins within an FSE environment?
 Integrating custom functionality or plugins within an FSE environment involves ensuring compatibility and seamless integration with the block editor:
1. **Plugin Compatibility**: Ensure that custom functionality or plugins are compatible with the block editor and do not conflict with FSE features.
2. **Block-based Functionality**: Whenever possible, implement custom functionality using block-based patterns or custom blocks to leverage the full potential of FSE.
3. **functions.php** can be used in order to add some custom functionality
