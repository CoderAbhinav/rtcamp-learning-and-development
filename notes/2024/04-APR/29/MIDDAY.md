# Block Editor : 29th April 2024 #185

## 1. When we register a block style using registerBlockStyle() of suppose name 'xyz' what is the classname which is assigned to the block's wrapper?
The classname assigned to the block's wrapper will be `is-style-xyz`.
## 2. In the PHP render callback function of a dynamic block which argument provides you data about the block like name, etc.?
By accessing the `$attributes` variable within the PHP render callback function, we can retrieve and manipulate the dynamic block's attributes to generate the appropriate HTML output based on the block's state and settings.
## 3. In a dynamic block in the edit function, you can render the dynamic block content using Javascript only. But how can you use the PHP render callback method there in the edit function to display the output? Which one is preferable?
- In the edit function of a dynamic block, you can render the block's content using JavaScript only. The PHP render callback method cannot be used directly in the edit function because the edit function runs on the client-side (in the browser), while the PHP render callback runs on the server-side.
- While it's technically possible to send a request to the server from the edit function to fetch the block's rendered content using the PHP render callback method, it's not a common practice and may introduce additional complexity and performance overhead.

## 4. How can you insert a block programmatically?
One common method is to use the `wp.data.dispatch( 'core/block-editor' ).insertBlocks()` Redux action to insert blocks into the editor programmatically.

```javascript
import { dispatch } from '@wordpress/data';

// Define block configuration
const blockConfig = {
    name: 'core/paragraph',
    attributes: {
        content: 'Inserted programmatically!',
    },
};

// Insert block programmatically
dispatch( 'core/block-editor' ).insertBlocks( blockConfig, index );

```

## 5. Explain removeEditorPanel with an example.
- `removeEditorPanel` is a JavaScript function in WordPress utilized to remove specific panels from the editor interface.
- For instance, to eliminate the Post Featured Image panel, you'd use: `wp.data.dispatch('core/edit-post').removeEditorPanel('featured-image');`
- This function operates within the `@wordpress/data` package and interacts with the editor's state management.
