# A Day in the life of rtcamp software engineering trainee

So to reach office I booked a cab from my friends place, there was a bit of traffic, but I reached to the office on time at 11.30 AM. I was so excited about my day at office, but I planned to go to office on the go, while I was travelling to Pune (Totally unplanned). I reached to Pride Icon, Kharadi. The rtcamp office is on first floor (Office No. 107). 

And how did I got in ?
So basically as I came inside the office at the reception, since we don't have any id cards, I was skeptical.
Guess what how did they confirmed I'm a rtcamper ? With the bag. They saw my bag, and immediately identified.

At 11.30 there weren't many people around, but marketing team was there working quite hard on our designs of new rtcamp website. I met Amit Datta (whome I met already at rtParty) instantly recognised, and offered me to sit at any place I want.

I choose the one near AC.

Took out my laptop, goosh, I was so excited, first day of my office, in the white coloured office, so nice. 
Connected to the office wifi, It does work quite good, maybe they changed the password so now the rtcampers are usinh the wifi (not the nearby offices).

After some time I went to the office coffee machine. Guess what it's a bit ambigous, but it gives CCD coffee, I made a expresso. Took to the desk. And there's a refregerator also (there is a lot of stuff from eggs, to licious kebbabs )

I started working for some time, started with understanding and planning the commits for my advance theme assignment.

Soon Ashreya (Learning & Development Team Member) reached the office. This was my first time communicating with the Learning & Development Team offline. 

Worked on few things. Then it was lunch time, surprisingly the office has a small pantry, they cook food for us. So I went there after my weekly pod sync, and there was some delicoius chicken curry, and some more chicken item, rotis, rice. 

While I was having lunch, I met with Manas Mali from accounts, and then met Ashutosh Bhosale from marketing, talked on a few topics (from how Kharadi has some of the highest rents to how work from home jobs are comfortable to IIT Chennai's heat).

After I came back from lunch started with some course content on GraphQL, JSX.

We had an awesome roundtable with marketing team, asked few questions.

Then most exciting thing, the daily check in,
as soon as we wrapped up with our daily checking routine, 
L&D team asked me "How's your day at office ?",
I was damm waiting for this questions, but then, I thought why not to show that to my rest of trainee friends,
So I gave them a short office tour, 
Showed them where we see the Friday's townhall projector screen,
the conference rooms, HR office,

And I was so excited, I even showed them, the office pantry, the fridge, the coffee machine, the lunch place.

And when bareen was talking about the reception, I took my laptop to reception to show the reception to the rest,
in flow I was explaining how the handles at the enterance have the rtcamp logo

And then at the end of day, I wrapped up my day, along with, doing the time entries and the daily blog.
That was such a wonderful day, I would be coming to office back frequently
