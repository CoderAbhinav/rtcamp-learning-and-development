# Custom Post Types
1. WordPress comes with five default post types: `post`, `page`, `attachment`, `revision`, and `menu`.
2. Using Custom Post Types, you can register your own post type.
	1. To register a new post type, you use the [register_post_type()](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/register_post_type/) function.
	```php
	function wporg_custom_post_type() {
		register_post_type('wporg_product',
			array(
				'labels'      => array(
					'name'          => __('Products', 'textdomain'),
					'singular_name' => __('Product', 'textdomain'),
				),
					'public'      => true,
					'has_archive' => true,
			)
		);
	}
	add_action('init', 'wporg_custom_post_type');
	
	```
## URLs
1. A custom post type gets its own slug within the site URL structure.
2. A post of type `wporg_product` will use the following URL structure by default: `http://example.com/wporg_product/%product_name%`.

# Taxonomies
A **Taxonomy** is a fancy word for the classification/grouping of things. Taxonomies can be hierarchical (with parents/children) or flat.

# Under the Hood: DB structure
## Tables Involved

- **wp_posts:** This core table stores all post data, including custom posts. Each post has attributes like ID, title, content, post type (e.g., "post", "page", your custom post type), and more.
- **wp_terms:** This table stores individual terms (categories, tags, custom taxonomy terms). Each term has an ID, name, slug, and taxonomy association.
- **wp_term_taxonomy:** This table acts as a bridge, linking taxonomies to terms. It stores the term ID and the taxonomy ID (identifies which taxonomy the term belongs to).
- **wp_term_relationships:** This table establishes the many-to-many relationship between posts and taxonomies. It has two columns: `object_ID` (which can be a post ID or another object ID depending on the context) and `term_taxonomy_id` (linking to the `wp_term_taxonomy` table).

## Relationship Breakdown

1. **Custom Post Data:** When you create a custom post, its information is stored in the `wp_posts` table, with the `post_type` field indicating your custom type (e.g., "product", "book").
2. **Taxonomy and Term Data:** When you define a custom taxonomy, its terms are stored in the `wp_terms` table. Each term has its name, slug, and an ID referencing the specific taxonomy it belongs to (stored in the `wp_term_taxonomy` table).
3. **Linking Posts and Taxonomies:** The `wp_term_relationships` table connects posts to taxonomies. For each custom post, this table stores the post's ID (`object_ID`) and the `term_taxonomy_id` of the term(s) associated with the post. This allows WordPress to efficiently retrieve posts based on their taxonomy terms.

## Key Points:

- A single custom post can belong to multiple taxonomies and have multiple terms associated with it (many-to-many relationship).
- The `wp_posts` table holds the core post data, while the other tables manage taxonomy and term relationships.
- Understanding these tables is crucial for working with custom post types and taxonomies in your WordPress plugins or themes.

## Additional Notes

- WordPress also uses the `wp_postmeta` table to store additional custom data associated with posts (including custom post types).
- There can be custom taxonomies beyond categories and tags, allowing you to categorize your content in more granular ways.


# Shadow/Utility Taxonomy
The term "shadow/utility taxonomy" isn't a standard term in WordPress or taxonomy theory. It's possible it's a custom term used within a specific codebase or documentation. Here are two interpretations that might be relevant:

**1. Internal/Hidden Taxonomy:**

- **Concept:** This could refer to a taxonomy that isn't directly exposed in the admin interface or used for public categorization. It might be used for internal organization or data filtering within a plugin or theme.
- **Use Case:** Imagine a plugin for managing e-commerce products. It could create a custom taxonomy named "product_visibility" with terms like "public," "hidden," and "on-sale." This taxonomy wouldn't be visible to users but would allow the plugin to control which products appear on the shop page or in specific product listings.

**2. Utility Taxonomy for Functionality:**

- **Concept:** This interpretation suggests a taxonomy used to categorize functionality or features within a plugin. It wouldn't be used for traditional content but for managing various plugin components.
- **Use Case:** A plugin for adding custom forms might use a taxonomy named "form_type" with terms like "contact," "survey," and "registration." This taxonomy wouldn't categorize posts but would help the plugin differentiate between different types of forms and their functionalities.

**In both cases:**

- The "shadow" or "utility" aspect implies the taxonomy serves a more behind-the-scenes purpose, not directly visible to the user but enabling specific plugin functionalities.

**Important Note:**

If you encounter this term in specific documentation or code, it's best to refer to the source documentation or consult with the plugin developer to understand the exact meaning and usage within that context.
