# Checking User Capabilities
1. If your plugin allows users to submit data—be it on the Admin or the Public side—it should check for User Capabilities.
2. **User roles** is just a fancy way of saying which group the user belongs to. Each group has a specific set of predefined capabilities.
3. **User capabilities** are the specific permissions that you assign to each user or to a User role.

# Sanitizing Data
1. _Sanitizing_ input is the process of securing/cleaning/filtering input data. Validation is preferred over sanitization because validation is more specific.
2. There are many functions that will help you sanitize your data.

# Validating Data
1. _Validating_ input is the process of testing data against a predefined pattern (or patterns) with a definitive result: valid or invalid.
2. Simple validation examples:
	- Check that required fields have not been left blank
	- Check that an entered phone number only contains numbers and punctuation
	- Check that an requested string is one of five valid options
	- Check that a quantity field is greater than 0
## Validation Philosophies
1. Safelist
2. Comparison Operator
3. `in_array()`
4. `switch`
5. Blocklist
6. Format Detection


# Escaping Data
1. _Escaping_ output is the process of securing output data by stripping out unwanted data, like malformed HTML or script tags. This process helps secure your data prior to rendering it for the end user.

## Escaping Functions
1. `esc_html()` – Use anytime an HTML element encloses a section of data being displayed. This will remove HTML.
```
<h4><?php echo esc_html( $title ); ?></h4>
```

2. `esc_js()` – Use for inline Javascript.
```
<div onclick='<?php echo esc_js( $value ); ?>' />
```

3. `esc_url()` – Use on all URLs, including those in the src and href attributes of an HTML element.
```
<img alt="" src="<?php echo esc_url( $media_url ); ?>" />
```

4. `esc_url_raw()` – Use when storing a URL in the database or in other cases where non-encoded URLs are needed.
5. `esc_xml()` – Use to escape XML block.
6. `esc_attr()` – Use on everything else that’s printed into an HTML element’s attribute.
```
<ul class="<?php echo esc_attr( $stored_class ); ?>">
```
7. `esc_textarea()` – Use this to encode text for use inside a textarea element.
8. `wp_kses()` – Use to safely escape for all non-trusted HTML (post text, comment text, etc.). This preserves HTML.
9. `wp_kses_post()` – Alternative version of `wp_kses()`that automatically allows all HTML that is permitted in post content.
10. `wp_kses_data()` – Alternative version of `wp_kses()`that allows only the HTML permitted in post comments.

## Always escape late
## Escaping with Localization
1. Rather than using `echo` to output data, it’s common to use the WordPress localization functions, such as `_e()` or `__()`.
2. These helper functions combine localization and escaping:
	1. [esc_html__()](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/esc_html__/)
	2. [esc_html_e()](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/esc_html_e/)
	3. [esc_html_x()](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/esc_html_x/)
	4. [esc_attr__()](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/esc_attr__/)
	5. [esc_attr_e()](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/esc_attr_e/)
	6. [esc_attr_x()](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/esc_attr_x/)

# Nonce
1. A nonce is a “number used once” to help protect URLs and forms from certain types of misuse, malicious or otherwise.
2. Technically, WordPress nonces aren’t strictly numbers; they are a hash made up of numbers and letters.
3. WordPress’s security tokens are called “nonces”
	1. They help protect against several types of attacks including CSRF.
	2. Do not protect against replay attacks.
	3. Nonces should never be relied on for authentication, authorization, or access control.

## Why to use nonce ?
1. consider that an admin screen might generate a URL like this that trashes post number 123. `http://example.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=123&action=trash`
2. When you go to that URL, WordPress will validate your authentication cookie information and, if you’re allowed to delete that post, will proceed to delete it.
3. What an attacker can do with this is make your browser go to that URL without your knowledge, example: `<img src="http://example.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=123&action=trash" />`
4. This would trigger your browser to make a request to WordPres,  WordPress would consider this a valid request.

## Creating a Nonce
You can create a nonce and add it to the query string in a URL, you can add it in a hidden field in a form, or you can use it some other way

### Adding a nonce URL
```php
$complete_url = wp_nonce_url( $bare_url, 'trash-post_'.$post->ID );

$complete_url = wp_nonce_url( $bare_url, 'trash-post_'.$post->ID, 'my_nonce' );

// Sample URL, note the & in there
$url = 'http://localhost/?arg1=value1&arg2=value2';

// This will show http://localhost/?arg1=value1&amp;amp;arg2=value2&amp;amp;_wpnonce=abcdef
echo wp_nonce_url( $url, 'action' );
```

### Adding a nonce field
```php
wp_nonce_field( 'delete-comment_'.$comment_id );
```

This will echo something like
```html
<input type="hidden" id="_wpnonce" name="_wpnonce" value="796c7766b1" />
<input type="hidden" name="_wp_http_referer" value="/wp-admin/edit-comments.php" />
```

### Creating a nonce in some other way
```php
$nonce = wp_create_nonce( 'my-action_'.$post->ID );

// simply returns something like `295a686963`
```

## Verifying a nonce
### Verifying a nonce passed from an admin screen  
To verify a nonce that was passed in a URL or a form in an admin screen, call `check_admin_referer()` specifying the string representing the action.

For example:

```php
check_admin_referer( 'delete-comment_'.$comment_id );
```

### [Verifying a nonce passed in an AJAX request](https://developer.wordpress.org/apis/security/nonces/#verifying-a-nonce-passed-in-an-ajax-request)

To verify a nonce that was passed in an AJAX request, call [check_ajax_referer()](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/check_ajax_referer/) specifying the string representing the action. For example:

For example:

```php
check_ajax_referer( 'process-comment' );
```


## Modifying Nonce
1. By default, a nonce has a lifetime of one day. After that, the nonce is no longer valid even if it matches the action string.
2. To change the lifetime, add a `nonce_life` filter specifying the lifetime in seconds.

```php
add_filter( 'nonce_life', function () { return 4 * HOUR_IN_SECONDS; } );
```

3. You can also perform additional verification 

```php
function wporg_additional_check ( $action, $result ) {
    ...
}
add_action( 'check_admin_referer', 'wporg_additional_check', 10, 2 );
```

## Additional Information
### Nonce Lifetime
1. WordPress uses a system with two ticks (half of the lifetime) and validates nonces from the current tick and the last tick.
2. In default settings (24h lifetime) this means that the time information in the nonce is related to how many 12h periods of time have passed since the Unix epoch.
### [Nonce security]
Nonces are generated using a key and salt that are unique to your site if you have installed WordPress correctly. `NONCE_KEY` and `NONCE_SALT` are defined in your `wp-config.php` file, and the file contains comments that provide more information.
