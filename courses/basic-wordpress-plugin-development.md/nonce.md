# Nonce

WordPress’s security tokens are called “nonces”.

1. A nonce is a “number used once” to help protect URLs and forms from certain types of misuse, malicious or otherwise.
2. WordPress nonces aren’t strictly numbers; they are a hash made up of numbers and letters. Nor are they used only once: they have a limited “lifetime” after which they expire. 
3. During that time period, the same nonce will be generated for a given user in a given context. 


## Why use a nonce ?
1. Consider that an admin screen might generate a URL like this that trashes post number 123.
`http://example.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=123&action=trash`
2. When you go to that URL, **WordPress will validate** your authentication cookie information and, if you’re allowed to delete that post, will proceed to delete it. What an attacker can do with this is make your browser go to that URL without your knowledge. For example, the attacker could craft a disguised link on a 3rd party page like this:
`<img src="http://example.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=123&action=trash" />`
3. This would trigger your browser to make a request to WordPress, and the browser would automatically attach your authentication cookie and WordPress would consider this a valid request.
4. **Adding a nonce would prevent this**. For example, when using a nonce, the URLs that WordPress generate for the user look like this:
`http://example.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=123&action=trash&_wpnonce=b192fc4204`
5. If anyone attempts to trash post number 123 without having the correct nonce generated by WordPress and given to the user, WordPress will send a **“403 Forbidden”** response to the browser.
