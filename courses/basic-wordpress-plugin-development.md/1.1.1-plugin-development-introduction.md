# Introduction to WordPress Plugin Development
1. Basic rule **don't touch wordpress core**.
2. Plugins are packages of code that extend the core functionality of WordPress. WordPress plugins are made up of PHP code and can include other assets such as images, CSS, and JavaScript.
3. Most WordPress plugins are composed of many files, but a plugin really only _needs_ one main file with a specifically formatted [DocBlock](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHPDoc#DocBlock) in the header.
4. So basically anything with [DocBlock](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHPDoc#DocBlock) under the `wp-content/plugins` folder will be considered as a plugin.

# Plugin Basics
At its simplest, a WordPress plugin is a PHP file with a WordPress plugin header comment.
To get started creating a new plugin, follow the steps below.

1. Navigate to the WordPress installation’s **wp-content** directory.
2. Open the **plugins** directory.
3. Create a new directory and name it after the plugin (e.g. `plugin-name`).
4. Open the new plugin’s directory.
5. Create a new PHP file (it’s also good to name this file after your plugin, e.g. `plugin-name.php`).

## Hooks & Actions
1. WordPress hooks allow you to tap into WordPress at specific points to change how WordPress behaves without editing any core files.
2. Actions allow you to add or change WordPress functionality.
3. Filters allow you to alter content as it is loaded and displayed to the website user.
4. Under the hood even the actions uses the `filters`.
5. The 3 basic hooks you’ll need when creating a plugin are the [register_activation_hook()](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/register_activation_hook/) , the [register_deactivation_hook()](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/register_deactivation_hook/) , and the [register_uninstall_hook()](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/register_uninstall_hook/) .
	1. The [activation hook](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/the-basics/activation-deactivation-hooks/) is run when you _activate_ your plugin. You would use this to provide a function to set up your plugin — for example, creating some default settings in the `options`table.
	2. The [deactivation hook](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/the-basics/activation-deactivation-hooks/) is run when you _deactivate_ your plugin. You would use this to provide a function that clears any temporary data stored by your plugin.
	3. These [uninstall methods](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/the-basics/uninstall-methods/) are used to clean up after your plugin is _deleted_ using the WordPress Admin. You would use this to delete all data created by your plugin, such as any options that were added to the `options` table.
6. You can add your own, custom hooks with [do_action()](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/do_action/) , which will enable developers to extend your plugin by passing functions through your hooks.
7. You can also use invoke [remove_action()](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/remove_action/) to remove a function that was defined earlier.

## How WordPress loads Plugins
1. When WordPress loads the list of installed plugins on the Plugins page of the WordPress Admin, it searches through the `plugins` folder (and its sub-folders) to find PHP files with WordPress plugin header comments.
2. And when the WP Core loads, then in that case, the `wp-settings.php` finds all the `active_plugins` by checking the option by the same name, and loads all the files of these plugins.

# Header Requirements

**Minimum Fields**
```php
/*
 * Plugin Name: YOUR PLUGIN NAME
 */
```

**Or here's a standard example:**

```php
<?php

/**
* The `rt-movie-library` file.
*
* Contains header, entry point for `rt-movie-library`.
*
* @package RtMovieLibrary
* @author Abhinav Belhekar <coderabhinav.github.io>
* @copyright 2024 Abhinav Belhekar
* @license GPL-2.0-or-later
*
* @wordpress-plugin
* Plugin Name: rt Movie Library
* Plugin URI: https://github.com/coderabhinav/rt-movie-library
* Description: The plugin lets you manage movie library.
* Version: 1.0.0
* Requires at least: 5.2
* Requires PHP: 7.4
* Author: Abhinav Belhekar
* Author URI: https://coderabhinav.github.io
* Text Domain: rt-movie-library
* License: GPL v2 or later.
* License URI: http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.txt
* Update URI: https://github.com/coderabhinav/rt-movie-library

```

# Activation & Deactivation Hooks

## [Activation](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/plugin-basics/activation-deactivation-hooks/#activation)

To set up an activation hook, use the [register_activation_hook()](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/register_activation_hook/) function:

```php
register_activation_hook(
	__FILE__,
	'pluginprefix_function_to_run'
);
```

## [Deactivation](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/plugin-basics/activation-deactivation-hooks/#deactivation)

To set up a deactivation hook, use the [register_deactivation_hook()](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/register_deactivation_hook/) function:

```php
register_deactivation_hook(
	__FILE__,
	'pluginprefix_function_to_run'
);
```


# Best Practices
1. Avoid name collision, so for this **prefix everything**.
```php
/**
 * Current plugin directory url
 */
define( 'RTML_PLUGIN_DIR_URL', plugin_dir_url( __FILE__ ) );

/**
 * The core plugin class that is used to define internationalization,
 * admin-specific hooks, and public-facing site hooks.
 */
define( 'RTML_PLUGIN_DIR_PATH', plugin_dir_path( __FILE__ ) );
```

2. Use OOP concepts
3. File Organisation
```
/plugin-name
     plugin-name.php
     uninstall.php
     /languages
     /includes
     /admin
          /js
          /css
          /images
     /public
          /js
          /css
          /images
```

4. Implement conditional loading of the files.
5. Avoid direct access
```php
if ( ! defined( 'ABSPATH' ) ) {
	exit; // Exit if accessed directly
}
```

# [Determining Plugin and Content Directories](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/plugin-basics/determining-plugin-and-content-directories/)

# Uninstall Methods
1. Your plugin may need to do some clean-up when it is uninstalled from a site.
2. A plugin is considered uninstalled if a user has deactivated the plugin, and then clicks the delete link within the WordPress Admin.

## Method 1: Register Uninstall Hook
```php
register_uninstall_hook(
	__FILE__,
	'pluginprefix_function_to_run'
);
```
## Method 2: uninstall.php
To use this method you need to create an `uninstall.php` file inside the root folder of your plugin. This magic file is run automatically when the users deletes the plugin.
