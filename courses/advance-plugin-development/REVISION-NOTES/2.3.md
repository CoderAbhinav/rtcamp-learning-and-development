# Object Caching
1. The WordPress Object Cache is used to save on trips to the database. The Object Cache stores all of the cache data to memory and makes the cache contents available by using a key, which is used to name and later retrieve the cache contents.
2. To avoid multiple database queries , WordPress stores its data in object cache as a key-value pairs in `$wp_object_cache` variable, in `cache.php`.

## Role of the WordPress Object Cache
1. By default, the object cache is non-persistent. This means that data stored in the cache resides in memory only and only for the duration of the request.
