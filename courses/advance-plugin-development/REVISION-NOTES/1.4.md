# Rewrite Rules
1. WordPress allows theme and plugin developers to programmatically specify new, custom rewrite rules.
2. Note that these rules are usually called inside the init hook. Furthermore, permalinks will need to be refreshed before the rewrite changes will take effect. Requires one-time use of `flush_rules()` to take effect.

## Functions
### [`add_rewrite_tag()`]()
1. Adds a new rewrite tag (like %postname%).
2. Parameters
    - `$tag` name of new rewrite tag.
    - `$regex` Regular expression to substitute the tag for in rewrite rules.
    - `$query` String to append to the rewritten query. Must end in `=` 

**Example**

In the following examples, imagine a site has a custom taxonomy ‘location’ and all posts are assigned a location term like “Paris” or “Madrid”. We add a rewrite tag “%location%” to establish the location query var. We also add a rewrite rule so that an URL such as example.com/goto/madrid/budget-lodging/ is properly handled.

```php
add_action('init', 'add_my_rewrites');
function add_my_rewrites() {
    add_rewrite_tag('%location%', '([^&]+)');
    add_rewrite_rule('^goto/([^/]*)/([^/]*)/?','index.php?location=$matches[1]&name=$matches[2]','top');
}
```

In order to retrive the tag, just use

```php
$wp_query->query_vars['location']
```

### [`add_rewrite_rule()`]()
1. Adds a rewrite rule that transforms a URL structure to a set of query vars.

```php
add_rewrite_rule(
    string $regex, // Regex to match
    string | array $query, // Conversion to query
    string $after = 'bottom' // Where to place ? `top` or `bottom` ?
)
```

```php
<?php
function custom_rewrite_rule() {
    add_rewrite_rule('^nutrition/([^/]*)/([^/]*)/?','index.php?page_id=12&food=$matches[1]&variety=$matches[2]','top');
}
add_action('init', 'custom_rewrite_rule', 10, 0);
```
