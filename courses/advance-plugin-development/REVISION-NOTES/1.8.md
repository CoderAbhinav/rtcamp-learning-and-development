# WP CRON

1. WP-Cron works by checking, on every page load, a list of scheduled tasks to see what needs to be run. Any tasks due to run will be called during that page load.
    - If a page is not loaded for a long time, then all the scheduled tasks will run as soon as the next page load takes place.
2. Why to use WP CRON over the system one ?
    - Most of the providers don't give access to system (in the case of WP hosting).
    - WordPress core and many plugins need a scheduling system to perform time-based tasks. Without the need of the system cron.
    -  With WP-Cron, all scheduled tasks are put into a queue and will run at the next opportunity, and all the tasks will run 100%.

## Hooking WP-Cron Into the System Task Scheduler
1. WP-Cron does not run continuously, which can be an issue if there are critical tasks that must run on time
    - A solution could be a system cron job which requests the `wp-cron.php` file every time.
    - Since you are pinging the WP CRON, you no longer need wordpress to run the cron jobs on every load, so define following in the `wp-config.php` file
        ```php
        define( 'DISABLE_WP_CRON', true );
        ```
2. How can we schedule a cron job
    - Let's look for the MacOS, (this runs the `command` every 15 minutes)
        ```bash
        */15 * * * * command
        ```
    - If you are using a server then they have `wget`
        ```bash
        0 0 * * * wget --delete-after http://YOUR_SITE_URL/wp-cron.php
        ```

## Scheduling WP Cron Events
### Adding the Hook
1. In order to run your task, you need to create a hook. (`bl_` part is the plugin prefix).
    ```php
    add_action( 'bl_cron_hook', 'bl_cron_exec' );
    ```
### Scheduling the Task
1. To schedule a cron job hook, we use the [`wp_schedule_event()`](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/wp_schedule_event/)
    ```php
    wp_schedule_event(
        int $timestamp, // Next UNIX epoch for the next run of event.
        string $recurrence, // Recurrence.
        string $hook, // Hook to be running.
        array args = array(), // Args to pass to the hook. 
        bool $wp_error = false // Whether to return WP_Error or not 
    ): bool | WP_Error
    ```
    **Usage**
    ```php
    // This will schedule `bl_cron_hook` every 5 seconds immediately.
    wp_schedule_event( time(), 'five_seconds', 'bl_cron_hook' );
    ```
2. The above function will schedule a cron job every time it's called, so this means, at every page load a new cron job will be scheduled. So how can we stop this ?
    - We need to use [`wp_next_schedule()`](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/wp_next_scheduled/)
    ```php
    wp_next_schedule(
        string $hook, // Hook information you want.
        array $args = array() 
    )
    ```
    **Usage**
    ```php
    // Wrapping the function such that it only schedules the event once.
    if ( ! wp_next_scheduled( 'bl_cron_hook' ) ) {
        wp_schedule_event( time(), 'five_seconds', 'bl_cron_hook' );
    }
    ```
3. How can we unschedule a task ?
    - We use the [`wp_unschedule_event()`](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/wp_unschedule_event/)
    ```php
    $timestamp = wp_next_scheduled( 'bl_cron_hook' );
    wp_unschedule_event( $timestamp, 'bl_cron_hook' );
    ```
    - Remember to always **unschedule** all the cron job at the time of plugin or theme deactivation.

## Testing of WP-Cron
1. You can use `WP-CLI`
    ```bash
    wp cron event run {job name}
    ```
2. WP-Cron management plugins.
3. [`_get_cron_array()`](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/_get_cron_array/)
4. [`wp_get_schedules()`](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/wp_get_schedules/)

## Understanding WP-Cron Scheduling
1. WP-Cron is given two arguments: the time for the first task, and an interval (in seconds) after which the task should be repeated.
2. The default intervals provided by WordPress are:
    - hourly
    - twicedaily
    - daily
    - weekly (since WP 5.4)

### Adding Custom Intervals
1. The filter `cron_schedules` allows us to add additional intervals.
    ```php
    add_filter( 'cron_schedules', 'example_add_cron_interval' );
    function example_add_cron_interval( $schedules ) { 
        $schedules['five_seconds'] = array(
            'interval' => 5,
            'display'  => esc_html__( 'Every Five Seconds' ), );
        return $schedules;
    }
    ```
