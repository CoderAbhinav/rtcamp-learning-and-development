# States
1. We can use regular variables in React however there’s a problem with storing vital data in regular variables as this **data can be lost between re-renders**; therefore we need to store vital data in a way that the data is not lost between re-renders.
2. This is where states come into play. States are special kinds of storage spaces that store the data and this data cannot be lost between re-renders.
3. States will hold the data from the **mounting of the component till the component unmounts** or in other words, the state of a component will be maintained throughout the component’s life cycle.
