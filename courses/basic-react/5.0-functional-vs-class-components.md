# Functional Components
1. Functional components are those components that are created using the help of functions.
2. They use hooks for lifecycle methods like useEffect. Functional components also use hooks to replicate the behaviour of class-based components.
3. These components are know as *stateless* but can be made *stateful* using the hook `useState`  [[6.0-hooks]]

```jsx
function Car() {
  return <h2>Hi, I am a Car!</h2>;
}

export default Car;
```

# Class Components
1. **Before React 16.8**, Class components were the only way to track state and lifecycle on a React component. Function components were considered *"state-less"*.
2. With the addition of *Hooks*, Function components are now almost **equivalent** to Class components. The differences are so minor that you will probably never need to use a Class component in React.

```jsx
class Container extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {show: true};
  }
  delHeader = () => {
    this.setState({show: false});
  }
  render() {
    let myheader;
    if (this.state.show) {
      myheader = <Child />;
    };
    return (
      <div>
      {myheader}
      <button type="button" onClick={this.delHeader}>Delete Header</button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

class Child extends React.Component {
  componentWillUnmount() {
    alert("The component named Header is about to be unmounted.");
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    );
  }
}

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<Container />);
```
