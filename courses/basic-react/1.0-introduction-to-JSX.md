# How JSX Works Under the Hood ?
Reference: [How JSX (React) Works Under the Hood](https://www.telerik.com/blogs/how-jsx-react-works-under-hood) by [Ifeoma Imoh](https://www.telerik.com/blogs/author/ifeoma-imoh)

1. JSX stands for JavaScript syntax extension. It is a JavaScript extension that allows us to describe React’s object tree using a syntax that resembles that of an HTML template.
2. Because JSX is not valid JavaScript, browsers can’t read it directly; they do not know what to do with it, so we need a transpiler ( #transpiler ) to translate it to `React.createElement()`calls.
3. Refer [[2.3-react-and-next#React#Introduction To JSX JSX]]
4. Hoping you gone through the link in the above point let's understand what it looks after transpiling
	1. So basically the `React.createElement` function accepts three parameters

	```javascript
	React.createElement(
	  type,
	  [props],
	  [...children]
	)
	```

	2. Let's make a react component using `JSX`

	```javascript
	import React from 'react'
	
	  function App (){
	    return (
	      <div>
	    <p>This is a list</p>
	    <ul>
	      <li>List item 1</li>
	      <li>List item 2</li>
	    </ul>
	  </div>
	  );
	};
```

3. The compiled code should look something like this,
	
	```javascript
	import React from 'react'
	
	function App() {
	  return React.createElement(
	    "div",
	    null,
	    React.createElement("p", null, "This is a list"),
	    React.createElement(
	    "ul",
	    null,
	    React.createElement("li", null, "List item 1"),
	    React.createElement("li", null, "List item 2")));
	  }
	```

4. The `React.createElement()` should create something like this,

```javascript
{
    "type": "div",
    "key": null,
    "ref": null,
    "props": {
      "children": [
        {
          "type": "p",
          "key": null,
          "ref": null,
          "props": {
            "children": "This is a list"
          },
          "_owner": null
        },
        {
          "type": "ul",
          "key": null,
          "ref": null,
          "props": {
            "children": [
              {
                "type": "li",
                "props": {
                  "children": "List item 1"
                },
                // truncated for brevity
              },
              {
                "type": "li",
                "props": {
                  "children": "List item 2"
                },
                // truncated for brevity
              }
            ]
          },
          "_owner": null
        }
      ]
    },
    "_owner": null
}
```

## Important JSX Rules
1. You can only return one top level element from a given component. This is usually known as a parent element and is used to group the content.
```jsx
// You can't do this, as it will not work and will return the first div.
return (
	<div>
		<p>Section 1</p>
	</div>
	<div>
		<p>Section 2</p>
	</div>
);

// But this is valid

return (
	<>
		<div>
			<p>Section 1</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<p>Section 2</p>
		</div>
	</>
);

```
2. In react JSX every tag has closing tag. like `<hr/>` or `<img/>`.
3. A react component must be capitalised, if not then they will be treated as built in components, means `<MyComponent/>` is valid, but not `<myComponent/>` as the later one will be interpreted as a build in component and will result in string output.
4. 1. To include JavaScript expressions in JSX, you need to wrap them in curly braces. Content between the opening and closing curly braces will be evaluated as JavaScript.
	```jsx
	let myVar = "Abhinav";
	
	return (
		<div>
			{
				myVar
			}
		</div>
	)
	```
5. The term “class” is a reserved keyword in JavaScript. In React, we must substitute className for class.
