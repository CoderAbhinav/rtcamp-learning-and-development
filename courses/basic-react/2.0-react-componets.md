# React Components
## Virtual DOM
The virtual DOM (VDOM) is a programming concept where an ideal, or “virtual”, representation of a UI is kept in memory and synced with the “real” DOM by a library such as ReactDOM. This process is called [reconciliation](https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/reconciliation.html).
### Shadow DOM vs Virtual DOM
The Shadow DOM is a browser technology designed primarily for scoping variables and CSS in web components. The virtual DOM is a concept implemented by libraries in JavaScript on top of browser APIs.

## Reconciliation
1. Whenever you update the UI using the `render()` function, react needs to find a way to update the real DOM with your updates.
2. If we used this in React, displaying 1000 elements would require in the order of one billion comparisons. This is far too expensive. Instead, React implements a heuristic O(n) algorithm based on two assumptions:
	1. Two elements of different types will produce different trees.
	2. The developer can hint at which child elements may be stable across different renders with a `key` prop.
	In practice, these assumptions are valid for almost all practical use cases.


# Components
React lets you combine your markup, CSS, and JavaScript into custom “components”, **reusable UI elements for your app.**

## How to define components ?

1. The `export default` prefix is a [standard JavaScript syntax](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/web/javascript/reference/statements/export) (not specific to React). It lets you mark the main function in a file so that you can later import it from other files.
2. With `function Profile() { }` you define a JavaScript function with the name `Profile`.
	1. **Note:** React components are regular JavaScript functions, but **their names must start with a capital letter** or they won’t work!
3. The component returns an `<img />` tag with `src` and `alt` attributes. `<img />` is written like HTML, but it is actually JavaScript under the hood! This syntax is called [JSX](https://react.dev/learn/writing-markup-with-jsx), and it lets you embed markup inside JavaScript.
	1. **Note:** Without parentheses, any code on the lines after `return` [will be ignored](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2846283/what-are-the-rules-for-javascripts-automatic-semicolon-insertion-asi)!
4. Now that you’ve defined your `Profile` component, you can nest it inside other components.
	1. **Note:** Components can render other components, but **you must never nest their definitions:**

```jsx
export default function Profile() {
  return (
    <img
      src="https://i.imgur.com/MK3eW3Am.jpg"
      alt="Katherine Johnson"
    />
  )
}
```
