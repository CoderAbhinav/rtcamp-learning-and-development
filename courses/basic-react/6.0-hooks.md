# `useState`
1. Components often need to change what’s on the screen as a result of an interaction.
2. `useState` is a hook that returns a state variable and a state setter. The state is initialized with the argument passed to the useState hook.
3. **Local variables don’t persist between renders.** When React renders this component a second time, it renders it from scratch—it doesn’t consider any changes to the local variables.
4. **Changes to local variables won’t trigger renders.** React doesn’t realize it needs to render the component again with the new data.
5. The [`useState`](https://react.dev/reference/react/useState) Hook provides those two things:
	1. A **state variable** to retain the data between renders.
	2. A **state setter function** to update the variable and trigger React to render the component again.
6. **Hooks—functions starting with `use`—can only be called at the top level of your components or [your own Hooks.](https://react.dev/learn/reusing-logic-with-custom-hooks)** You can’t call Hooks inside conditions, loops, or other nested functions.

```jsx
import { useState } from 'react';
import { sculptureList } from './data.js';

export default function Gallery() {
  const [index, setIndex] = useState(0);

  function handleClick() {
    setIndex(index + 1);
  }

  let sculpture = sculptureList[index];
  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={handleClick}>
        Next
      </button>
      <h2>
        <i>{sculpture.name} </i> 
        by {sculpture.artist}
      </h2>
      <h3>  
        ({index + 1} of {sculptureList.length})
      </h3>
      <img 
        src={sculpture.url} 
        alt={sculpture.alt}
      />
      <p>
        {sculpture.description}
      </p>
    </>
  );
}

```

## Anatomy Of `useState`
When you call [`useState`](https://react.dev/reference/react/useState), you are telling React that you want this component to remember something:
```jsx
const [index, setIndex] = useState(0);
```

The convention is to name this pair like `const [something, setSomething]`. You could name it anything you like, but conventions make things easier to understand across projects.

## [State is isolated and private](https://react.dev/learn/state-a-components-memory#state-is-isolated-and-private "Link for State is isolated and private")

State is local to a component instance on the screen. In other words, **if you render the same component twice, each copy will have completely isolated state!** Changing one of them will not affect the other.

```jsx
import Gallery from './Gallery.js';

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <div className="Page">
      <Gallery />
      <Gallery />
    </div>
  );
}
```

In this example even though `<Gallary />` is called multiple times the state variables are different for both.

# `useEffect`
1. `useEffect` is a hook that is used to perform some side-effects in a component like a network calls, or subscribing to an event.
2. Cleanup functions are recommended in useEffect so that we can stop memory leaks.
3. There can be multiple useEffect in a single component where each useEffect can focus on different things.

## Effects Without Cleanup

### Example Using `useEffect` hook

```jsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
function Example() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {    document.title = `You clicked ${count} times`;  });
  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

**What does `useEffect` do?** By using this Hook, you tell React that your component needs to do something after render. React will remember the function and call it later after performing the DOM updates.

**Why is `useEffect` called inside a component?** Placing `useEffect` inside the component lets us access the `count` state variable (or any props) right from the effect.

**Does `useEffect` run after every render?** Yes! By default, it runs both after the first render _and_ after every update.

## Effects With Cleanup
### Example Using Hooks

```jsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function FriendStatus(props) {
	const [isOnline, setIsOnline] = useState(null);
	
	useEffect(() => {
		function handleStatusChange(status) {      
			setIsOnline(status.isOnline);    
		}    
		ChatAPI.subscribeToFriendStatus(props.friend.id, handleStatusChange);    
		// Specify how to clean up after this effect:    
		return function cleanup() {
			ChatAPI.unsubscribeFromFriendStatus(props.friend.id, handleStatusChange);    
		};  
	});
	  
	if (isOnline === null) {
		return 'Loading...';
	}
	
	return isOnline ? 'Online' : 'Offline';
}
```

**Why did we return a function from our effect?** This is the optional cleanup mechanism for effects. Every effect may return a function that cleans up after it. This lets us keep the logic for adding and removing subscriptions close to each other. They’re part of the same effect!

**When exactly does React clean up an effect?** React _also_ cleans up effects from the previous render before running the effects next time.

## Solving the Infinite Loop of `useEffect()`

### Problem

```jsx
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

function CountInputChanges() {
  const [value, setValue] = useState('');
  const [count, setCount] = useState(-1);

  useEffect(() => setCount(count + 1));

  const onChange = ({ target }) => setValue(target.value);

  return (
    <div>
      <input type="text" value={value} onChange={onChange} />
      <div>Number of changes: {count}</div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

In the above code, there's an issue, which is, as soon as we update the `value`  state, it triggers the render, and then the `useEffect()` as soon as this function runs, it triggers another render, and thus our app goes into an infinite loop.

### 1.1 Fixing Dependancies
1. The infinite loop is fixed with correct management of the `useEffect(callback, dependencies)` dependencies argument.
2. Because you want `count` to increment when `value` changes, you can simply add `value` as a dependency of the side-effect
3. By adding `[value]` as a dependency of `useEffect(..., [value])`, the `count` state variable will only be updated when `[value]` changes. This solves the infinite loop.

```jsx
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

function CountInputChanges() {
  const [value, setValue] = useState('');
  const [count, setCount] = useState(-1);

  useEffect(() => setCount(count + 1), [value]);

  const onChange = ({ target }) => setValue(target.value);

  return (
    <div>
      <input type="text" value={value} onChange={onChange} />
      <div>Number of changes: {count}</div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### 1.2 Using a reference
1. An alternative solution is to use a reference (created by [useRef()](https://dmitripavlutin.com/react-useref-guide/) hook) to store the number of changes of the input.
2. The idea is that updating a reference doesn't trigger re-rendering of the component.

```jsx
import { useState, useRef } from 'react';

function CountInputChanges() {
  const [value, setValue] = useState('');
  const countRef = useRef(0);

  const onChange = ({ target }) => {
    setValue(target.value);
    countRef.current++;
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <input type="text" value={value} onChange={onChange} />
      <div>Number of changes: {countRef.current}</div>
    </div>
  );
}
```


### The infinite loop and new objects references
Even if you set up correctly the `useEffect()` dependencies, still, you have to be careful when using objects as dependencies.

# `useCallback()`

 1. `useCallback` is a React Hook that lets you cache a function definition between re-renders.
 2. `useCallback` is a Hook, so you can only call it **at the top level of your component** or your own Hooks. You can’t call it inside loops or conditions.
 3. React **will not throw away the cached function unless there is a specific reason to do that.**
 4. When you optimize rendering performance, you will sometimes need to cache the functions that you pass to child components.

## Skipping re-rendering components
```jsx

import { useCallback } from 'react';

function ProductPage({ productId, referrer, theme }) {
  const handleSubmit = useCallback((orderDetails) => {
    post('/product/' + productId + '/buy', {
      referrer,
      orderDetails,
    });
  }, [productId, referrer]);
  // ...

```

**By wrapping `handleSubmit` in `useCallback`, you ensure that it’s the _same_ function between the re-renders** (until dependencies change).
