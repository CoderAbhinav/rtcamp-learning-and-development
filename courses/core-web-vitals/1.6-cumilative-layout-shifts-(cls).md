# Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)
The main purpose of Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) metric is, to have a good user experience by not allowing a webpage elements to be moved while it loads or while user interacts with it.

Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) is a stable Core Web Vital metric. It's an important, user-centric metric for measuring[visual stability](https://web.dev/articles/user-centric-performance-metrics#types_of_metrics) because it helps quantify how often users experience unexpected layout shifts. A low CLS helps ensure that the page is [delightful](https://web.dev/articles/user-centric-performance-metrics#defining_metrics).

### What is a good CLS score?

To provide a good user experience, a site must have a CLS score of **0.1** or less. To ensure you're hitting this target for most of your users, we recommend measuring the **75th percentile** of page loads, segmented across mobile and desktop devices.

![Good CLS values are 0.1 or less, poor values are greater than 0.25, and anything in between needs improvement](https://web.dev/static/articles/cls/image/good-cls-values-are-01-a42d66f2d0f42.svg)

*Good CLS values are 0.1 or less. Poor values are greater than 0.25.*
