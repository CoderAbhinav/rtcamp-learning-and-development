# Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)
The web page will have good LCP if the largest contentful paint loads within 2.5 seconds.

It will be again a good time to reconsider the content structure of the page. Because sometimes we will not need bigger images in the webpage above the fold.


# Browser-level image lazy loading for the web
You can use the `loading` attribute to lazy-load images without the need to write custom lazy-loading code or use a separate JavaScript library. Here's a [demo](https://mathiasbynens.be/demo/img-loading-lazy) of the feature:

## Why browser-level lazy loading?

According to the [HTTP Archive](https://httparchive.org/reports/page-weight), images are the most-requested asset type for most websites, and they usually take up more bandwidth than any other resource. At the 90th percentile, sites send over 5 MB of images on desktop and mobile.
## The `loading` attribute
Chrome loads images at different priorities depending on where they're located relative to the device viewport.
```html
<img src="image.png" loading="lazy" alt="…" width="200" height="200">
```

Here are the supported values for the `loading` attribute:

- `lazy`: Defer loading of the resource until it reaches a [calculated distance](https://web.dev/articles/browser-level-image-lazy-loading#distance-from-viewport) from the viewport.
- `eager`: Default loading behavior of the browser, which is the same as not including the attribute and means the image is loaded regardless of where it's located on the page. This is the default, but it can be useful to set explicitly if your tooling automatically adds `loading="lazy"` when there's no explicit value, or if your linter complains if it isn't explicitly set.

### Relationship between the `loading` attribute and fetch priority

The `eager` value is an instruction to load the image as usual, without delaying the load further if the image is off-screen. It doesn't load the image faster than another image that doesn't have a `loading` attribute.
If you want to increase the fetch priority of an important image (for example, the LCP image), use [Fetch Priority](https://web.dev/articles/fetch-priority) with`fetchpriority="high"`.

### Distance-from-viewport thresholds

All images that are immediately viewable without scrolling load normally. Images far below the device viewport are only fetched when the user scrolls near them.
## Improved data-savings and distance-from-viewport thresholds

In July 2020, Chrome made significant improvements to align the image lazy loading distance-from-viewport thresholds to better meet developer expectations.

On fast connections (4G), we reduced Chrome's distance-from-viewport thresholds from `3000px` to `1250px` and on slower connections (3G or lower), changed the threshold from `4000px` to `2500px`. This change achieves two things:

- `<img loading=lazy>` behaves closer to the experience offered by JavaScript lazy loading libraries.
- The new distance-from-viewport thresholds still means images will probably have loaded by the time a user has scrolled to them.

**Old thresholds versus new thresholds:**

### Give your images dimension attributes

While the browser loads an image, it doesn't immediately know the image's dimensions, unless they're explicitly specified. To let the browser reserve enough space on a page for images, and avoid disruptive [layout shifts](https://web.dev/articles/cls), we recommend adding `width` and `height` attributes to all `<img>` tags.
