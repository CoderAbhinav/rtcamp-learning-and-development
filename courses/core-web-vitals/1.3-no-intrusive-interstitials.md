# No Intrusive Interstitials
## What is an Intrusive Interstitial ?
[Intrusive interstitials](https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2016/08/helping-users-easily-access-content-on.html) are essentially popup ads. They tend to block most or all of a page, leading to a bad user experience for desktop and mobile users alike.

The kicker is that while popups are moderately annoying on desktops, there is even less screen real estate to work with on mobile devices. In these cases, it can completely ruin the user experience. Here are a few examples of how this goes wrong:

1. The interstitial covers most or all of the content on a page.
2. The interstitial is not responsive. That means it is difficult or impossible to close it on a mobile, rendering the page useless for mobile users.
3. The interstitial is not triggered by an action, such as “Click here to subscribe.” Rather, it pops up on its own without prompting, creating an unpleasant surprise for the mobile viewer.

## Why Are Intrusive Interstitials Being Targeted?
As frustrating as users find popups, companies continue to use them because they are effective. In one recent [study of 1,754,957,675 popups](https://sumome.com/stories/pop-up-examples), there was an average 3.09% conversion rate, with high-performing popups performing on average at 9.28%.

It’s important to note that Google is currently only looking at interstitials that show up when the user first lands on the website from a search result. **This means the important part is ensuring that any traffic coming from Google isn’t served these interstitials until the user has clicked further into the site.**

## Intrusive Interstitials That Will Be Penalized
The first is a regular popup, or a modal window blocking the content of the page.

The second is a standalone, full-screen interstitial that sits above the header of the website. These interstitials typically force your browser to scroll up to see it before letting you see the rest of the content.

The last is also a standalone, but essentially a full-screen modal window blocking the content.

## Conclusion

As the deadline draws near, we urge you to check your interstitials and ensure they follow Google’s new guidelines. Though it’s not clear how strong this new ranking signal will be, Google shows a definitive preference for mobile. We recommend that you don’t underestimate its power.

It is relatively straightforward to identify your intrusive interstitials and take action:

1. Review required interstitials, such as age-verification popups and cookie notifications. You’ll leave these live, but ensure they are easy to use on mobile devices.
2. Find the interstitials on your site, leading directly from Google search, that act as advertisements.
3. If these are so effective that you can’t justify getting rid of them, try modifying them to take up a small amount of screen space for mobile devices. Otherwise, we recommend removing them entirely.
