## What is FID?

FID measures the time from when a user first interacts with a page (that is, when they click a link, tap on a button, or use a custom, JavaScript-powered control) to the time when the browser is actually able to begin processing event handlers in response to that interaction.

### What is a good FID score?

To provide a good user experience, sites should strive to have a First Input Delay of **100 milliseconds** or less. To ensure you're hitting this target for most of your users, a good threshold to measure is the **75th percentile** of page loads, segmented across mobile and desktop devices.

## FID in detail

As developers who write code that responds to events, we often assume our code is going to be run immediately—as soon as the event happens. But as users, we've all frequently experienced the opposite—we've loaded a web page on our phone, tried to interact with it, and then been frustrated when nothing happened.

The above visualization shows a page that's making a couple of network requests for resources (most likely CSS and JS files), and—after those resources are finished downloading—they're processed on the main thread.

Long first input delays typically occur between [First Contentful Paint (FCP)](https://web.dev/articles/fcp) and [Time to Interactive (TTI)](https://web.dev/articles/tti) because the page has rendered some of its content but isn't yet reliably interactive. To illustrate how this can happen, FCP and TTI have been added to the timeline:

### What if an interaction doesn't have an event listener?

FID measures the delta between when an input event is received and when the main thread is next idle. This means FID is measured **even in cases where an event listener has not been registered.** The reason is because many user interactions do not require an event listener but _do_ require the main thread to be idle in order to run.

### Why only consider the first input?

While a delay from any input can lead to a bad user experience, we primarily recommend measuring the first input delay for a few reasons:
- The first input delay will be the **user's first impression** of your site's responsiveness, and first impressions are critical in shaping our overall impression of a site's quality and reliability.
### What counts as a first input?

FID is a metric that measures a page's responsiveness during load. As such, it only focuses on input events from discrete actions like clicks, taps, and key presses.

### What if a user never interacts with your site?
This means some users will have no FID values, some users will have low FID values, and some users will probably have high FID values.

### Why only consider the input delay?

As mentioned above, FID only measures the "delay" in event processing. It does not measure the total event processing duration itself, nor the time it takes the browser to update the UI after running event handlers.
