# WP Coding Standards: JS

The WordPress JavaScript Coding Standards are adapted from the jQuery JavaScript Style Guide. Our standard differs from the (jQuery guidelines)[https://contribute.jquery.org/style-guide/js/] in the following ways:
- WordPress uses single quotation marks for string declarations.
- Case statements are indented within switch blocks.
- Function contents are consistently indented, including full-file closure wrappers.
- Some whitespace rules differ, for consistency with the WordPress PHP coding standards.
- jQueryâ€™s 100-character hard line limit is encouraged, but not strictly enforced.
