## [What are templates?](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/templates/introduction-to-templates/#what-are-templates)

In a nutshell, templates take dynamic data and wrap it into structured HTML markup, which is then sent to the browser.

The templating system in WordPress does a few important things:

- Parses block markup, which is used to reference static and dynamic data.
- Retrieves dynamic data (e.g., post content, site options, etc.) from the database.
- Sends the resulting HTML to the visitorâ€™s browser.
