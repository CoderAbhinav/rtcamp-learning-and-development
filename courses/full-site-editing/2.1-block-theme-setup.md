# Theme Structure
At its most basic, a theme’s structure will look similar to the following. Take note of the files/folders marked **required** because they are necessary for a block theme to work:

- `parts/`
    - `footer.html`
    - `header.html`
- `patterns/`
    - `example.php`
- `styles/`
    - `example.json`
- `templates/`
    - `404.html`
    - `archive.html`
    - `index.html` (required)
    - `singular.html`
- `README.txt`
- `functions.php`
- `screenshot.png`
- `style.css` (required)
- `theme.json`
## Required files

There are two necessary files for WordPress to recognize your block theme, and you will learn more about these in the coming documentation:

- **`style.css`** ([Main Stylesheet](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/core-concepts/main-stylesheet/)): This file is required for configuring theme data, such as its name and description. It can also be used for adding custom CSS.
- **`templates/index.html`** ([Templates](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/core-concepts/templates/)): The default/fallback template. This is necessary for WordPress to consider this a block theme.

# Main Stylesheet
## File Header
The `style.css` file header is used to configure data about the theme. WordPress uses this information to determine how some features work and displays some of this data under the **Appearance > Themes** screen for users.

It shows the theme screenshot, description, and metadata.](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/11/tt3-theme-details.jpg?resize=2048%2C1002&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/11/tt3-theme-details.jpg?ssl=1)
For WordPress to recognize your theme, you would at least need the `Theme Name` field defined at the top of `style.css` like so:

```css
/**
 * Theme Name: Fabled Sunset
 */
```


## Header fields

There are many supported fields, and you will likely use most of them in your themes. Here is a quick look at a theme’s `style.css` file header with each of the fields configured:

```css
/**
 * Theme Name:        Fabled Sunset
 * Theme URI:         https://example.com/fabled-sunset
 * Description:       Custom theme description...
 * Version:           1.0.0
 * Author:            Your Name
 * Author URI:        https://example.com
 * Tags:              block-patterns, full-site-editing
 * Text Domain:       fabled-sunset
 * Domain Path:       /assets/lang
 * Tested up to:      6.4
 * Requires at least: 6.2
 * Requires PHP:      7.4
 * License:           GNU General Public License v2.0 or later
 * License URI:       https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html
 */
```

The following list outlines what each of these fields does.

While the `Theme Name` is the only field required to work with WordPress, you must also include some other fields when submitting a theme to the WordPress theme directory. These fields are marked with ***** below.

- **Theme Name*:** A unique name for your theme.
- **Theme URI:** The URL of a public web page where users can find more information about the theme.
- **Description*:** A description of the theme, which will be displayed when viewing a theme’s details in the WordPress admin and other places. It is also used for themes submitted to the WordPress theme directory.
- **Version*:** The version of the theme, written in `X.X` or `X.X.X` format.
- **Author*:**  Your name or the name of the organization who developed the theme. For themes submitted to the theme directory, it is recommended to use the WordPress.org username.
- **Author URI:** The URL of the individual or organization who created the theme.
- **Tags:** A comma-separated list of features the theme supports. The Theme Review Handbook has a [list of valid tags](https://make.wordpress.org/themes/handbook/review/required/theme-tags/) for submission to the theme directory, but third-party sites may use a different system.
- **Text Domain*:** The string used for the textdomain for translations.
- **Domain Path:** A relative path to where theme translations are stored. WordPress uses this field when the theme is disabled to detect translations. Defaults to `/languages`.
- **Tested up to*:** The last WordPress version the theme has been tested up to, written in `X.X`format (e.g., `6.`4, `6.2.1`, etc.).
- **Requires at least*:** The oldest WordPress version the theme will work with, written in `X.X`format (e.g., `6.3`, `6.2.1`, etc.).
- **Requires PHP*:** The oldest PHP version the theme will work with, written in `X.X` format (e.g., `8.0`, `7.4`, etc.).
- **License*:** The license for the theme.
- **License URI*:** The URL of the theme’s license.

## Child theme header fields

When building a child theme, there is one additional supported field: **Template**. This is used to designate the parent theme’s folder.

If the fictional “Fabled Sunset” theme listed above was the parent of your child theme named “Grand Sunrise,” your `style.css` header fields would look similar to this:

[Copy](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/core-concepts/main-stylesheet/#)

```css
/**
 * Theme Name: Grand Sunrise
 * Template:   fabled-sunset
 * ...other header fields
 */
```

The `Template` field must match the parent theme’s folder name exactly (relative to the `wp-content/themes` directory) for this to work. Otherwise, WordPress will not be able to appropriately match them.
