# Blocks
To follow along with this tutorial, you can [download the accompanying WordPress plugin](https://github.com/WordPress/block-development-examples)which includes all the examples for you to try on your own site.

Gutenberg was released as part of WordPress 5.0 in December 2018.

# Block Editor Handbook
The [**Block Editor**](https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/) is a modern paradigm for WordPress site building and publishing.
The Block Editor consists of several primary elements, as shown in the following figure:

![Quick view of the Block Editor](https://i0.wp.com/raw.githubusercontent.com/WordPress/gutenberg/trunk/docs/assets/overview-block-editor-2023.png?ssl=1)

The elements highlighted are:

1. **Inserter:** A panel for inserting blocks into the content canvas
2. **Content canvas:** The content editor, which holds content created with blocks
3. **Settings Panel** A panel for configuring a block’s settings when selected or the settings of the post

Through the Block Editor, you create content modularly using blocks. Many [blocks](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/core-blocks/) are available in WordPress by default, and you can also [create your own](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/getting-started/create-block/).

**A [block](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/explanations/architecture/key-concepts/#blocks) is a discrete element such as a Paragraph, Heading, Media, or Embed. Each block is treated as a separate element with individual editing and format controls.**

## [Most Used Blocks](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/blocks-list/#most-used-blocks)

You will also find a Most Used blocks category which is not shown by default. This category will be visible only if you enable ‘Show most used blocks’ in your [Preferences](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/preferences-overview/#blocks). 

When enabled, the Most Used blocks category will be displayed right above the Text blocks category. It will list all the blocks that you used recently on your post or page.

## FAQ Crux
“Gutenberg” is the name of the project to create a new editor experience for WordPress [ref](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/getting-started/faq/#what-is-gutenberg) It’s built on the idea of using “blocks” to write and design posts and pages. This will serve as the foundation for future improvements to WordPress, including blocks as a way not just to design posts and pages, but also entire sites.

### [When was Gutenberg merged into WordPress?](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/getting-started/faq/#when-was-gutenberg-merged-into-wordpress)

Gutenberg was first merged into [WordPress 5.0](https://wordpress.org/news/2018/12/bebo/) in December 2018. See [the versions in WordPress page](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/principles/versions-in-wordpress/) for a complete list of Gutenberg plugin versions merged into WordPress core releases.

### [Is Gutenberg built on top of TinyMCE?](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/getting-started/faq/#is-gutenberg-built-on-top-of-tinymce)

No. [TinyMCE](https://www.tinymce.com/) is only used for the “Classic” block.

### [How is data stored? I’ve seen HTML comments. What is their purpose?](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/getting-started/faq/#how-is-data-stored-ive-seen-html-comments-what-is-their-purpose)

Our approach—as outlined in [the technical overview introduction](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/01/17/editor-technical-overview/)—is to augment the existing data format in a way that doesn’t break the decade-and-a-half-fabric of content WordPress provides. In other terms, this optimizes for a format that prioritizes human readability (the HTML document of the web) and easy-to-render-anywhere over a machine convenient file (JSON in post-meta) that benefits the editing context primarily.

### [How do shortcodes work in Gutenberg?](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/getting-started/faq/#how-do-shortcodes-work-in-gutenberg)

Shortcodes continue to work as they do now.

However we see the block as an evolution of the `[shortcode]`. Instead of having to type out code, you can use the universal inserter tray to pick a block and get a richer interface for both configuring the block and previewing it. We would recommend people eventually upgrade their shortcodes to be blocks.

### [Should I move shortcodes to content blocks?](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/getting-started/faq/#should-i-move-shortcodes-to-content-blocks)

We think so for a variety of reasons including but not limited to:

- Blocks have visual editing built-in which creates a more rich, dynamic experience for building your site.
- Blocks are simply html and don’t persist things the browser doesn’t understand on the front-end. In comparison, if you disable a plugin that powers a shortcode, you end up with strange visuals on the front-end (often just showing the shortcode in plain text).
- Blocks will be discovered more readily with the launch of the block directory in a way shortcodes never could be allowing for more people to get more functionality.
