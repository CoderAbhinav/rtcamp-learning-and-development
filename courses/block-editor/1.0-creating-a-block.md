# Getting Started (Handbook)

## Block Development Environment
### Node.js development environment
The Node Package eXecute ([`npx`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v10/commands/npx)) tool is used to run commands from packages without installing them globally and is commonly used when scaffolding blocks with the [`create-block`](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/packages/packages-create-block/) package.

### What's `wp-env` ?
The [@wordpress/env](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@wordpress/env) package (`wp-env`) lets you set up a local WordPress environment (site) for building and testing plugins and themes, without any additional configuration.
Before following this guide, install [Node.js development tools](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/getting-started/devenv/#node-js-development-tools) if you have not already done so.

![wp-env basics diagram](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/10/wp-env-diagram.png?ssl=1)

## [Quick start](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/getting-started/devenv/get-started-with-wp-env/#quick-start)

1. Download, install, and start [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) following the instructions for your operating system.
2. Run `npm -g install @wordpress/env` in the terminal to install `wp-env` globally.
3. In the terminal, navigate to an existing plugin directory, theme directory, or a new working directory.
4. Run `wp-env start` in the terminal to start the local WordPress environment.
5. After the script runs, navigate to `http://localhost:8888/wp-admin` and log into the WordPress dashboard using username `admin` and password `password`.


### Getting started with `create-block`
If you have your own [local WordPress development environment](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/getting-started/devenv/#local-wordpress-environment) already set up, navigate to the `plugins/` folder using the terminal.

Run the following command to scaffold an example block plugin:

```bash
npx @wordpress/create-block@latest todo-list
cd todo-list
```

The `slug` provided (`todo-list`) defines the folder name for the scaffolded plugin and the internal block name.

When `create-block` scaffolds the block, it installs `wp-scripts` and adds the most common scripts to the block’s `package.json` file. By default, those include:

```json
{
    "scripts": {
        "build": "wp-scripts build",
        "format": "wp-scripts format",
        "lint:css": "wp-scripts lint-style",
        "lint:js": "wp-scripts lint-js",
        "packages-update": "wp-scripts packages-update",
        "plugin-zip": "wp-scripts plugin-zip",
        "start": "wp-scripts start"
    }
}
```

These scripts can then be run using the command `npm run {script name}`. The two scripts you will use most often are `start` and `build` since they handle the build step.

When working on your block, use the `npm run start` command. This will start a development server and automatically rebuild the block whenever any code change is detected.

When you are ready to deploy your block, use the `npm run build` command. This optimizes your code and makes it production-ready.

See the `wp-scripts` [package documentation](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/packages/packages-scripts/) for more details about each available script.


# Fundamentals Of Block Development
## File Structure Of a Block
[![Open File Structure of a Block diagram image](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/11/file-structure-block.png?ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/11/file-structure-block.png?ssl=1 "Open File Structure of a Block diagram image")
When developing custom blocks for WordPress, it’s best practice to register them within plugins rather than themes. This strategy guarantees that your blocks stay accessible, even when users switch themes.

### \<plugin-file>.php
When creating a block in a WordPress plugin, you usually register the block on the server in the main PHP file of the plugin. This is done using the [`register_block_type()`](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/register_block_type/) function.

### package.json
The `package.json` file is used to configure a Node.js project, which is technically what a block plugin is. In this file, you define the `npm` dependencies of the block and the scripts used for local development.

### src folder
In a standard project, the `src` (source) folder contains the raw, uncompiled code, including JavaScript, CSS, and other assets necessary for developing the block.

#### block.json
1. The `block.json` file contains the [block’s metadata](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/getting-started/fundamentals/file-structure-of-a-block/docs/block-editor/reference-guides/block-api/block-metadata/), streamlining its definition and registration across client-side and server-side environments.
2. This file includes the block name, description, [attributes](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/getting-started/fundamentals/file-structure-of-a-block/docs/block-editor/reference-guides/block-api/block-attributes.md), [supports](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/getting-started/fundamentals/file-structure-of-a-block/docs/block-editor/reference-guides/block-api/block-supports.md), and more, as well as the locations of essential files responsible for the block’s functionality, appearance, and styling.
3. A few of the most important properties that can be defined in a `block.json` are:
	- **[`editorScript`](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/block-api/block-metadata/#editor-script):** Usually set with the path of a bundled `index.js` file that was built from `src/index.js`.
	- **[`style`](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/block-api/block-metadata/#style):** Usually set with the path of a bundled `style-index.css` file that was built from `src/style.(css|scss|sass)`.
	- **[`editorStyle`](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/block-api/block-metadata/#editor-style):** Usually set with the path of a bundled `index.css` that was built from `src/editor.(css|scss|sass)`.
	- **[`render`](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/block-api/block-metadata/#render):** Usually set with the path of a bundled `render.php` that was copied from `src/render.php`.
	- **[`viewScript`](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/block-api/block-metadata/#view-script):** Usually set with the path of a bundled `view.js` that was built from `src/view.js`.

[![Open Build Output Diagram in excalidraw](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/11/file-structure-build-output.png?ssl=1)](https://excalidraw.com/#json=c22LROgcG4JkD-7SkuE-N,rQW_ViJBq0Yk3qhCgqD6zQ "Open Build Output Diagram in excalidraw")
#### index.js
The `index.js` file (or any other file defined in the `editorScript` property of `block.json`) is the entry point file for JavaScript that should only get loaded in the Block Editor.

#### edit.js
The `edit.js` file contains the React component responsible for rendering the block’s editing user interface, allowing users to interact with and customize the block’s content and settings in the Block Editor. This component gets passed to the [`edit`](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/block-api/block-edit-save/#edit) property of the `registerBlockType` function in the `index.js` file.

#### save.js
The `save.js` exports the function that returns the static HTML markup that gets saved to the WordPress database.

#### style.(css|scss|sass)
A `style` file with extensions `.css`, `.scss`, or `.sass` contains the styles of the block that will be loaded in both the Block Editor and on the front end. In the build process, this file is converted into `style-index.css`
It is usually defined using the [`style`](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/block-api/block-metadata/#style) property in `block.json`

#### editor.(css|scss|sass)
You will often use this file for styles specific to the block’s user interface. This file is converted to `index.css` during the build process, usually defined using the `editorStyle` property in `block.json`.

#### render.php
The `render.php` file (or any other file defined in the [`render`](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/block-api/block-metadata/#render) property of `block.json`) defines the server-side process that returns the markup for the block when there is a request from the front end.

#### view.js
The `view.js` file (or any other file defined in the [`viewScript`](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/block-api/block-metadata/#view-script) property of `block.json`) will be loaded in the front end when the block is displayed.

### build folder
The `build` folder contains the compiled and optimized versions of the code from the `src`folder. These files are generated from the [build process](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/getting-started/devenv/get-started-with-wp-scripts/#the-build-process-with-wp-scripts), triggered by the `build` or `start`commands of `wp-scripts`.

## block.json
[![Open block.json diagram image](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/11/block-json.png?ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/11/block-json.png?ssl=1 "Open block.json diagram image")
The `block.json` file simplifies the process of defining and registering a block by using the same block’s definition in JSON format to register the block on both the server and the client (Block Editor).

### Basic metadata of a block
Using `block.json` properties, you can define how the block will be uniquely identified and what information is displayed in the Block Editor. These properties include:

- **[`apiVersion`](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/block-api/block-metadata/#api-version):** Specifies the [API](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/block-api/block-api-versions/) version the block uses. Use the latest version unless you have specific requirements.
- **[`name`](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/block-api/block-metadata/#name):** The unique name of the block, including namespace (e.g., `my-plugin/my-custom-block`).
- **[`title`](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/block-api/block-metadata/#title):** The display title for the block, shown in the Inserter.
- **[`category`](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/block-api/block-metadata/#category):** The category under which the block appears in the Inserter. Common categories include `text`, `media`, `design`, `widgets`, and `theme`.
- **[`icon`](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/block-api/block-metadata/#icon):** An icon representing the block in the Inserter. This can be a [Dashicon](https://developer.wordpress.org/resource/dashicons) slug or a custom SVG icon.
- **[`description`](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/block-api/block-metadata/#description):** A short description of the block, providing more context than the title.
- **[`keywords`](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/block-api/block-metadata/#keywords):** An array of keywords to help users find the block when searching.
- **[`textdomain`](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/block-api/block-metadata/#text-domain):** The text domain for the block, used for internationalisation.

### Files for block's behaviour, output & style
The `block.json` file also allows you to specify the essential files for a block’s functionality:

- **[`editorScript`](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/block-api/block-metadata/#editor-script):** A JavaScript file or files for use only in the Block Editor.
- **[`editorStyle`](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/block-api/block-metadata/#editor-style):** A CSS file or files for styling within the Block Editor.
- **[`script`](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/block-api/block-metadata/#script):** A JavaScript file or files loaded in both the Block Editor and the front end.
- **[`style`](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/block-api/block-metadata/#style):** A CSS file or files applied in both the Block Editor and the front end.
- **[`viewScript`](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/block-api/block-metadata/#view-script):** A JavaScript file or files intended solely for the front end.
### Using block attributes to store data
Block [attributes](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/block-api/block-metadata/#attributes) are settings or data assigned to blocks. They can determine various aspects of a block, such as its content, layout, style, and any other specific information you need to store along with your block’s structure.

**Example `block.json`**
```json
"attributes": {
    "fallbackCurrentYear": {
        "type": "string"
    },
    "showStartingYear": {
        "type": "boolean"
    },
    "startingYear": {
        "type": "string"
    }
},
```

And it looks something like this in the content
```html
<!-- wp:block-development-examples/copyright-date-block-09aac3 {"fallbackCurrentYear":"2023","showStartingYear":true,"startingYear":"2020"} -->
<p class="wp-block-block-development-examples-copyright-date-block-09aac3">© 2020–2023</p>
<!-- /wp:block-development-examples/copyright-date-block-09aac3 -->
```

### Reading & Updating Attributes
[![Open Attributes diagram image](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/11/attributes.png?ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/11/attributes.png?ssl=1 "Open Attributes diagram image")
1. These [attributes](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/block-api/block-edit-save/#attributes) are passed to the block’s `Edit` React component for display in the Block Editor.
2. The `Edit` component uniquely possesses the ability to modify these attributes through the [`setAttributes`](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/block-api/block-edit-save/#setattributes) function.

### Using block supports to enable settings & styles
The [`supports`](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/block-api/block-metadata/#supports) property in `block.json` allows a block to declare support for a set of these common customization options.

Here’s an example of color supports defined in `block.json`:
```json
"supports": {
    "color": {
        "text": true,
        "link": true,
        "background": true
    }
}
```

The following code demonstrates how the attributes and CSS classes generated by enabling block supports are stored in the markup representation of the block.

```html
<!-- wp:block-development-examples/block-supports-6aa4dd {"backgroundColor":"contrast","textColor":"accent-4"} -->
<p class="wp-block-block-development-examples-block-supports-6aa4dd has-accent-4-color has-contrast-background-color has-text-color has-background">Hello World</p>
<!-- /wp:block-development-examples/block-supports-6aa4dd -->
```

## Registering of a block
1. Blocks in WordPress are typically bundled in a plugin and registered on both the server and client-side using `block.json` metadata.
2. While it’s possible to register blocks solely on the client-side, best practices strongly advise registering them on both the server and client.
[![Open Block Registration diagram image](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/11/block-registration-e1700493399839.png?ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2023/11/block-registration-e1700493399839.png?ssl=1 "Open Block Registration diagram image")
### Registering Block with PHP
1. Block registration on the server usually takes place in the main plugin PHP file with the [`register_block_type()`](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/register_block_type/) function called on the [`init`](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/hooks/init/) hook.
2. This function is designed to register block types and primarily uses two parameters in this context, although it can accommodate more variations:
	- **`$block_type` (`string`):** This can either be the path to the directory containing the `block.json` file
	- **`$args` (`array`):** By default, this is an empty array, but it can include various options, one of which is the `$render_callback`. This callback is used to render blocks on the front end and is an alternative to the `render` property in `block.json`.
3. The `register_block_type()` function returns the registered block type (`WP_Block_Type`) on success or `false` on failure.

### Registering Block with JavaScript
1. When the block has already been registered on the server, you only need to register the client-side settings in JavaScript using the [`registerBlockType`](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/packages/packages-blocks/#registerblocktype) method from the `@wordpress/blocks` package.

```js
import { registerBlockType } from '@wordpress/blocks';

registerBlockType( 'my-plugin/notice', {
    edit: Edit,
    // ...other client-side settings
} );
```

2. The function accepts two parameters:
	- **`blockNameOrMetadata` (`string`|`Object`):** This can either be the block type’s name as a string or an object containing the block’s metadata, which is typically loaded from the `block.json` file.
	- **`settings` (`Object`):** This is an object containing the block’s client-side settings.
3. The `settings` object passed as the second parameter includes many properties, but these are the two most important ones:
	- **`edit`:** The React component that gets used in the Editor for our block.
	- **`save`:** The function that returns the static HTML markup that gets saved to the database.
4. The `registerBlockType()` function returns the registered block type (`WPBlock`) on success or `undefined` on failure.

# Miscellaneous
## [@wordpress/scripts](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/packages/packages-scripts/#installation)
In the context of WordPress Gutenberg Block development, `@wordpress/wp-scripts` is a package that provides a collection of scripts to streamline the development process. It offers functionalities like:

- **Building and compiling code:** It automates tasks like compiling your JavaScript code (often written in JSX) and any styles you use in your block into a format that the browser can understand.
- **Development and Production Modes:** It provides separate functionalities for development (`wp-scripts start`) and production (`wp-scripts build`). The development mode includes features like watching for changes in your code and automatically recompiling for a faster development workflow. The production mode optimizes and minifies the code for better performance on live sites.
- **Linting and formatting:** It can help you identify and fix errors or stylistic inconsistencies in your code through linting and formatting tools.
- **Testing:** While not the main focus, it offers some basic functionalities for running unit tests for your block's JavaScript code.

Essentially, `@wordpress/wp-scripts` acts as a development toolset that helps you write, compile, test, and package your Gutenberg Blocks efficiently.
