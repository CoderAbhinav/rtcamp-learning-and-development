# Type Of Migrations
1. Migrations do not have any limit. We can migrate any type of content to #WordPress.
2. There are different ways of importing data like,
	1. `XML` or `WXR` reports
	2. `SQL` scripts
	3. `REST` endpoints
	4. Or we need to scrap `HTML`
3. We can use the pre-build plugins or we can create whole new WP-CLI scripts to migrate this data.
