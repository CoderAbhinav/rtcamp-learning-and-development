# Customizer API

# [Theme Handbook - Customizer API](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/customize-api/)
1. The Customize API (Customizer) is a framework for live-previewing any change to WordPress.
2. Themes and plugins alike can add options to the Customizer. 
3. Customizer options can be granted to users with different capabilities on a granular basis. Different parts of the Customizer can also be contextual to whether they’re relevant to the front-end context that the user is previewing.

## [Customizer Objects](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/customize-api/customizer-objects/)
![](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2017/01/Customize-Object-Hierarchy-Graphic.png?w=1280&ssl=1)

1. The customizer API is object oriented, and there are four main types of customize objects:
    - Panels: Containers for section.
    - Sections: UI containers for controls.
    - Settings
    - Controls
2. Each customizer object is managed by [`WP_Customize_Manager`](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/classes/wp_customize_manager/)
3. To add or remove any customizer object, and to access the customize manager, use the [`customize_register`](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/hooks/customize_register/)
    ```php
    function themeslug_customize_register( $wp_customize ) {
    // Do stuff with $wp_customize, the WP_Customize_Manager object.
    }
    add_action( 'customize_register', 'themeslug_customize_register' );
    ```
    - There are functions related to the manager, they are `add_`, `remove_`, `get_` ex. `add_panel`, `remove_panel`

### Settings
1. Settings handle live-previewing, saving, and sanitization of your customizer objects.
2. There are two primary types of settings: options and theme modifications.
    - Options are stored directly in the wp_options table of the WordPress database and apply to the site regardless of the active theme.
    -  Theme mods, on the other hand, are specific to a particular theme, they are also stored in the options table, under they key.
![](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2014/10/customize-theme-mods-options.png?w=1229&ssl=1)
```php
<?php
WP_Customize_Manager::add_setting(
    $id,
    $args = array(
        'types' // Default is 'theme_mod', other values 'option'
        'capabilitiy' // Default 'edit_theme_options'
        'theme_support' // Required theme support
        'default' // Default value
        'transport' // Options for rendering the live preview of changes in Customizer.
        'validate_callback' // Server-side validation callback for the setting’s value.
        'sanitize_callback' // Callback to filter a Customize setting value in un-slashed form.
        'sanitize_js_callback' // Callback to convert a Customize PHP setting value to a value that is JSON serializable.
        'dirty' // Whether or not the setting is initially dirty when created.
    )
);
```

```php
$wp_customize->add_setting( 'setting_id', array(
  'type' => 'theme_mod', // or 'option'
  'capability' => 'edit_theme_options',
  'theme_supports' => '', // Rarely needed.
  'default' => '',
  'transport' => 'refresh', // or postMessage
  'sanitize_callback' => '',
  'sanitize_js_callback' => '', // Basically to_json.
) );
```

And to access these settings, you can use the `get_theme_mod( $id )` to get the data. (You can also use the `get_options()` if it's in option type.)


### Controls
1. Every control must be associated with a setting, and that setting will save user-entered data from the control to the database

**Example**
```php
$wp_customize->add_control( 'setting_id', array(
  'type' => 'date', // Different types are <input>, checkbox, textarea, radio, select, dropdown-pages
  
  'priority' => 10, // Within the section.
  'section' => 'colors', // Required, core or custom.
  'label' => __( 'Date' ),
  'description' => __( 'This is a date control with a red border.' ),
  'input_attrs' => array(
    'class' => 'my-custom-class-for-js',
    'style' => 'border: 1px solid #900',
    'placeholder' => __( 'mm/dd/yyyy' ),
  ),
  'active_callback' => 'is_front_page',
) );
```

![Customizer API - Overview](https://youtu.be/B3vXpgdz5uA?si=9BPCF6u8ubbk2xCP)

1. We will learn about the `Customizer API`, and we will learn how to add custom settings to the `Customizer`.
2. If you check the `Appearance` menu in **WP Admin**, we can see a sub menu called `Customizer`, and if you click on this, you can see a panel in the left, and a preview in the right.
	1. Modify the parameters.
	2. You can immediately see the menus.
	3. BTW, you can also save these changes as a draft, in order to do so, just click on the *settings* icon just in the *publish* button, and now you can select, from the options like `save draft`, `schedule`, `publish`.
3. If you save the draft then you will get a preview link, how it is structured ? so basically, your normal page link and then there will be a query variable `?customize_changeset_uuid` with a value given as `a30f979c-fdb1-408c-89df-785d51e0e90a` so basically a UUID.
	1. If you want to see where the data is stored then, just go to the `wp_posts` table.
	2. In this table the `UUID` which we saw will be used as **post name** and the post type will be **`customize_changeset`**.
	3. And all the changes will be stored in `JSON` format under the **post_content**.
	4. With key structured like `{theme_slug}::{settings_id}`  => `{value}`
	5. The status of this post will be **draft**.
	6. Or if you schedule it as `schedule` then the **post_status** will be `future` .

![Extending Customizer Options](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vorl6KxsPz0)

1. In this video we will look how to add `customizer` settings.
2. **Settings** associate with **Controls**, these **controls** are used to allow user to edit those settings values.
3. Sections are containers for the **settings** while the **panels** are containers for **sections**.
4. All the objects inside the `customizer` are represented by `PHP` classes.
5. The action `customize_register` will execute once `Customizer API` is loaded and initialised, and this will pass the `WP_Customize_Manager` object instance to your callback.

![Customizer API - Adding Sections & Panels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk8eyMpWizg)

1. Basically we will be talking about how to add the **sections** and **panels**.
2. If you want to add the panels, you can also have an **argument** called `capabilities`, this can be used to restrict the users to use the panels or `customizer` settings.
3.
