# Customizer API

# [Theme Handbook - Customizer API](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/customize-api/)
1. The Customize API (Customizer) is a framework for live-previewing any change to WordPress.
2. Themes and plugins alike can add options to the Customizer. 
3. Customizer options can be granted to users with different capabilities on a granular basis. Different parts of the Customizer can also be contextual to whether they’re relevant to the front-end context that the user is previewing.

## [Customizer Objects](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/customize-api/customizer-objects/)
![](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2017/01/Customize-Object-Hierarchy-Graphic.png?w=1280&ssl=1)

1. The `customizer` API is object oriented, and there are four main types of `customize` objects:
    - Panels: Containers for section.
    - Sections: UI containers for controls.
    - Settings
    - Controls
2. Each `customizer` object is managed by [`WP_Customize_Manager`](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/classes/wp_customize_manager/)
3. To add or remove any `customizer `object, and to access the `customize` manager, use the [`customize_register`](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/hooks/customize_register/)
    ```php
    function themeslug_customize_register( $wp_customize ) {
    // Do stuff with $wp_customize, the WP_Customize_Manager object.
    }
    add_action( 'customize_register', 'themeslug_customize_register' );
    ```
    - There are functions related to the manager, they are `add_`, `remove_`, `get_` ex. `add_panel`, `remove_panel`

### Settings
1. Settings handle live-previewing, saving, and sanitisation of your customiser objects.
2. There are two primary types of settings: options and theme modifications.
    - Options are stored directly in the `wp_options` table of the WordPress database and apply to the site regardless of the active theme.
    -  Theme mods, on the other hand, are specific to a particular theme, they are also stored in the options table, under they key like `theme_mod_{$theme_slug}` and the values are stored in `JSON`.  BTW it's **auto-loaded** for active theme.
    - Now in the case of you storing it as a `option` then it is stored under `option_name` called `{$setting_id}`.
    
![](https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2014/10/customize-theme-mods-options.png?w=1229&ssl=1)

```php
<?php
WP_Customize_Manager::add_setting(
    $id,
    $args = array(
        'types' // Default is 'theme_mod', other values 'option'
        'capabilitiy' // Default 'edit_theme_options'
        'theme_support' // Required theme support
        'default' // Default value
        'transport' // Options for rendering the live preview of changes in Customizer. Deafult to `refresh`
        'validate_callback' // Server-side validation callback for the setting’s value.
        'sanitize_callback' // Callback to filter a Customize setting value in un-slashed form.
        'sanitize_js_callback' // Callback to convert a Customize PHP setting value to a value that is JSON serializable.
        'dirty' // Whether or not the setting is initially dirty when created.
    )
);
```

```php
$wp_customize->add_setting( 'setting_id', array(
  'type' => 'theme_mod', // or 'option'
  'capability' => 'edit_theme_options',
  'theme_supports' => '', // Rarely needed.
  'default' => '',
  'transport' => 'refresh', // or postMessage
  'sanitize_callback' => '',
  'sanitize_js_callback' => '', // Basically to_json.
) );
```

And to access these settings, you can use the `get_theme_mod( $id )` to get the data. (You can also use the `get_options()` if it's in option type.)

### Controls
1. Every control must be associated with a setting, and that setting will save user-entered data from the control to the database.
2. And that setting will save user-entered data from the control to the database 

**Example**
```php
$wp_customize->add_control( 'setting_id', array(
  'type' => 'date', // Different types are <input>, checkbox, textarea, radio, select, dropdown-pages
  
  'priority' => 10, // Within the section. deafult is 10
  'section' => 'colors', // Required, core or custom.
  'label' => __( 'Date' ),
  'description' => __( 'This is a date control with a red border.' ),
  'input_attrs' => array(
    'class' => 'my-custom-class-for-js',
    'style' => 'border: 1px solid #900',
    'placeholder' => __( 'mm/dd/yyyy' ),
  ),
  'active_callback' => 'is_front_page',
) );
```

The most important parameter when adding a control is its type — this determines what type of UI the Customizer will display. Core provides several built-in control types:

- `<input>` elements with any allowed type (see below)
- `checkbox`
- `textarea`
- `radio` (pass a keyed array of values => labels to the `choices` argument)
- `select` (pass a keyed array of values => labels to the `choices` argument)
- `dropdown-pages` (use the `allow_addition` argument to allow users to add new pages from the control) also provide `choices` argument.

#### Core Custom Controls
1. If none of the basic control types suit your needs, you can easily create and add custom controls.
2. There are some additional controls like `WP_Customize_Color_Control`, `WP_Customize_Media_Control`, `WP_Customize_Upload_Control`, `WP_Customize_Cropped_Image_Control`.

```php
$wp_customize->add_control( new WP_Customize_Color_Control( $wp_customize, 'color_control', array(
  'label' => __( 'Accent Color', 'theme_textdomain' ),
  'section' => 'media',
) ) );
```

### Sections
1. Sections are UI containers for Customizer controls.
2. Use the [`add_section`](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/classes/wp_customize_manager/add_section/) method of the [`WP_Customize_Manager`](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/classes/wp_customize_manager/) object to add a new section

```php
$wp_customize->add_section( 'custom_css', array(
  'title' => __( 'Custom CSS' ),
  'description' => __( 'Add custom CSS here' ),
  'panel' => '', // Not typically needed.
  'priority' => 160,
  'capability' => 'edit_theme_options',
  'theme_supports' => '', // Rarely needed.
) );
```

3. You only need to include fields that you want to override the default values of.

| Title                | ID                | Priority (Order) |
| -------------------- | ----------------- | ---------------- |
| Site Title & Tagline | title_tagline     | 20               |
| Colors               | colors            | 40               |
| Header Image         | header_image      | 60               |
| Background Image     | background_image  | 80               |
| Menus (Panel)        | nav_menus         | 100              |
| Widgets (Panel)      | widgets           | 110              |
| Static Front Page    | static_front_page | 120              |
| _default_            |                   | 160              |
| Additional CSS       | custom_css        | 200              |
### Panels
1. More than simply grouping sections of controls, panels are designed to provide distinct contexts for the Customizer, such as Customizing Widgets, Menus, or perhaps in the future, editing posts.

	**Note**: **Themes should not register their own panels in most cases**.
	
	```php
	$wp_customize->add_panel( 'menus', array(
	  'title' => __( 'Menus' ),
	  'description' => $description, // Include html tags such as <p>.
	  'priority' => 160, // Mixed with top-level-section hierarchy.
	) );
	$wp_customize->add_section( $section_id , array(
	  'title' => $menu->name,
	  'panel' => 'menus',
	) );
	```

#### [Custom Controls, Sections, and Panels](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/customize-api/customizer-objects/#custom-controls-sections-and-panels)
Custom Controls, Sections, and Panels can be easily created by subclassing the PHP objects associated with each Customizer object: [`WP_Customize_Control`](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/classes/wp_customize_control/), [`WP_Customize_Section`](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/classes/wp_customize_section/), and [`WP_Customize_Panel`](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/classes/wp_customize_panel/)

```php
class WP_New_Menu_Customize_Control extends WP_Customize_Control {
  public $type = 'new_menu';
  /**
  * Render the control's content.
  */
  public function render_content() {
  ?>
    <button class="button button-primary" id="create-new-menu-submit" tabindex="0"><?php _e( 'Create Menu' ); ?></button>
  <?php
  }
}
```

### [Custom Setting Types](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/customize-api/customizer-objects/#custom-setting-types)
1. By default, the Customizer supports saving settings as options or theme modifications. But this behavior can be easily overwritten

```php
$wp_customize->add_setting( $nav_menu_setting_id, array(
  'type' => 'nav_menu',
  'default' => $item_ids,
) );
```

2. The setting will no longer be saved or previewed when its value is changed in the associated control. Now, you can use the `customize_update_$setting->type` and`customize_preview_$setting->type` actions to implement custom saving and previewing functionality.

## Tools for Improved User Experience
### Contextual Controls, Sections, Panels
1. You can either add an argument `activation_callback` which needs a callback which says whether to show the current control/section/panel or not.

```php
//...
'active_callback' => 'prefix_return_is_page';
//...
function prefix_return_is_page() {
  return is_page();
}
```

2. In the case if you are extending any of the core classes in order to create any custom control/section/panel then also override the `activation_callback` function.

```php
class WP_Customize_Greeting_Control extends WP_Customize_Control {
  // ...
  function active_callback() {
    return is_front_page();
  }
}
```

3. But there's another way around
	1. Use filter `customize_control_active` which provides two arguments to the callback, one if `$active`, other is `$control`.
	2. So let's say based on the condition in the callback, set the `$active` variable to true or false, this will tell the WP whether to add or remove the current object.
```php
// Hide all controls without a description when previewing single posts.
function title_tagline_control_filter( $active, $control ) {
  if ( '' === $control->description ) {
    $active = is_singular();
  }
  return $active;
}
add_filter( 'customize_control_active', 'title_tagline_control_filter', 10, 2 );
```


### Selective Refresh: Fast, Accurate
1. Selective Refresh updates in the Customizer “preview” only refresh areas whose associate settings are changed.
2. The logic in pure-JavaScript `postMessage` updates is duplicated. The JavaScript in the Customizer must mirror the PHP that produces the markup, or take shortcuts to approximate it.
3. But Selective Refresh is DRY as there’s no duplication of JavaScript and PHP. An Ajax request retrieves the new markup for the preview.
4. Selective refresh partials provide an association between areas of the preview and their corresponding settings. And also provides visible edit shortcuts.

The `transport` argument in the WordPress Customizer API controls how changes made to settings are reflected in the preview window. It essentially defines the communication method between the Customizer controls and the preview. Here's a breakdown of the two most common options and their differences:

**1. `postMessage` (Preferred):**

- **Use:** This is the **recommended** transport method for most scenarios. It utilizes the browser's `postMessage` API for efficient two-way communication.
- **Functionality:** When a user interacts with a control and changes a setting value, JavaScript in the customizer sends a message to the preview iframe containing the updated value. The preview code then receives this message, updates the relevant styles or content based on the new value, and re-renders the preview accordingly. This allows for a more dynamic and seamless user experience, as changes are reflected almost instantly without a full page refresh.
- **Benefits:**
    - Faster and smoother user experience with live updates.
    - Efficient communication method, reducing server load.
    - Suitable for most customization options that affect CSS or JavaScript.

**2. `refresh`:**

- **Use:** This method triggers a full page refresh whenever a setting value is changed.
- **Functionality:** When a user modifies a setting, the Customizer sends a request to the server to save the new value. The server then reloads the entire preview page, reflecting the updated settings.
- **Drawbacks:**
    - Less user-friendly due to the full page refresh, interrupting the editing flow.
    - Can be slower and less performant compared to `postMessage`.
- **When to use:** This method might be necessary in some situations where `postMessage` isn't suitable, such as:
    - Modifying core WordPress functionalities that rely on server-side processing and can't be updated with JavaScript alone.
    - Working with custom logic that requires a full page refresh to take effect.

**Choosing the right transport method:**

In most cases, **`postMessage`** is the preferred option due to its faster and more responsive user experience. However, if you're dealing with functionalities that require server-side updates or have custom logic dependent on full page reloads, then `refresh` might be necessary.

## The Customizer JavaScript API

### Preview JS & Control JS
1. The customizer app is currently split into two distinct areas: the customizer controls “pane” and the customize preview.
2. The preview is currently in an iframe, meaning that all JS runs either in the controls pane or in the preview.
3. The postMessage API is used to communicate between the preview and the controls.

### Models for Controls, Sections, Panels
1. As in PHP, each Customizer object type has a corresponding object in JavaScript.

```php
wp.customize.panel.each( function ( panel ) { /* ... */ } );
wp.customize.section.each( function ( section ) { /* ... */ } );
wp.customize.control.each( function ( control ) { /* ... */ } );
```

### Relating Controls, Sections & Panels Together
When registering a new control in PHP, you pass in the parent section ID:

```php
<?php
$wp_customize->add_control(
	'blogname',
	array(
		'label'   => __( 'Site Title' ),
		'section' => 'title_tagline',
	)
);
?>
```

In the JavaScript API, a control’s section can be obtained predictably:

```javascript
id = wp.customize.control( 'blogname' ).section(); // returns title_tagline by default
```

You can move a control to another section using this `section` state as well, here moving it to the Navigation section:


```javascript
wp.customize.control( 'blogname' ).section( 'nav' );
```

Likewise, you can get a section’s panel ID in the same way:

```javascript
id = wp.customize.section( 'sidebar-widgets-sidebar-1' ).panel(); // returns widgets by default
```

You can go the other way as well, to get the children of panels and sections:  

```javascript
sections = wp.customize.panel( 'widgets' ).sections();controls = wp.customize.section( 'title_tagline' ).controls();
```

You can use these to move all controls from one section to another:

```javascript
_.each( wp.customize.section( 'title_tagline' ).controls(), function ( control ) {  
    control.section( 'nav' );
} );
```

### Contextual Panels, Sections & Controls

```js
wp.customize.section( 'nav' ).deactivate(); // slide up
wp.customize.section( 'nav' ).activate({ duration: 1000 }); // slide down slowly
wp.customize.section( 'colors' ).deactivate({ duration: 0 }); // hide immediately
wp.customize.section( 'nav' ).deactivate({ completeCallback:
function () {  
    wp.customize.section( 'colors' ).activate(); // show after nav hides completely
} } );
```

### Focusing UI Objects

```js
wp.customize.control( 'page_on_front' ).focus()
```

### Priorities

When registering a panel, section, or control in PHP, you can supply a `priority` parameter. This value is stored in a `wp.customize.Value` instance for each respective `Panel`, `Section`, and `Control` instance. For example, you can obtain the priority for the widgets panel via:

```javascript
priority = wp.customize.panel( 'widgets' ).priority(); // returns 110 by default
```

You can then dynamically change the priority and the Customizer UI will automatically re-arrange to reflect the new priorities:

```javascript
wp.customize.panel( 'widgets' ).priority( 1 ); // move Widgets to the top
```



# Customizer API - rtCamp LMS Notes

## [Customizer API - Overview (Video)](https://youtu.be/B3vXpgdz5uA?si=9BPCF6u8ubbk2xCP)
![Customizer API - Overview](https://youtu.be/B3vXpgdz5uA?si=9BPCF6u8ubbk2xCP)

1. We will learn about the `Customizer API`, and we will learn how to add custom settings to the `Customizer`.
2. If you check the `Appearance` menu in **WP Admin**, we can see a sub menu called `Customizer`, and if you click on this, you can see a panel in the left, and a preview in the right.
	1. Modify the parameters.
	2. You can immediately see the menus.
	3. BTW, you can also save these changes as a draft, in order to do so, just click on the *settings* icon just in the *publish* button, and now you can select, from the options like `save draft`, `schedule`, `publish`.
3. If you save the draft then you will get a preview link, how it is structured ? so basically, your normal page link and then there will be a query variable `?customize_changeset_uuid` with a value given as `a30f979c-fdb1-408c-89df-785d51e0e90a` so basically a UUID.
	1. If you want to see where the data is stored then, just go to the `wp_posts` table.
	2. In this table the `UUID` which we saw will be used as **post name** and the post type will be **`customize_changeset`**.
	3. And all the changes will be stored in `JSON` format under the **post_content**.
	4. With key structured like `{theme_slug}::{settings_id}`  => `{value}`
	5. The status of this post will be **draft**.
	6. Or if you schedule it as `schedule` then the **post_status** will be `future` .

## [Extending Customizer Options (Video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vorl6KxsPz0)

![Extending Customizer Options](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vorl6KxsPz0)

1. In this video we will look how to add `customizer` settings.
2. **Settings** associate with **Controls**, these **controls** are used to allow user to edit those settings values.
3. Sections are containers for the **settings** while the **panels** are containers for **sections**.
4. All the objects inside the `customizer` are represented by `PHP` classes.
5. The action `customize_register` will execute once `Customizer API` is loaded and initialised, and this will pass the `WP_Customize_Manager` object instance to your callback.

![Customizer API - Adding Sections & Panels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk8eyMpWizg)

1. Basically we will be talking about how to add the **sections** and **panels**.
2. If you want to add the panels, you can also have an **argument** called `capabilities`, this can be used to restrict the users to use the panels or `customizer` settings.

## Customizer API Hooks & Filters

The WordPress Customizer API doesn't have a single, exhaustive list of actions and filters. However, it provides a number of hooks (actions and filters) at various points throughout the customization process. Here's a breakdown of the general categories:

**Actions:**

- **`customize_register`:** This action fires after the customizer object (`$wp_customize`) is instantiated and allows you to add custom controls, sections, and settings.
- **`customize_controls_enqueue_scripts`:** This action fires before enqueueing scripts for the customizer and allows you to enqueue your own custom scripts.
- **`customize_preview_init`:** This action fires before the preview iframe is loaded, allowing you to modify the preview functionality.
- **`customize_save`:** This action fires after saving customizer settings, allowing you to perform actions after saving the data.
- **Many specific actions** exist for individual control types (e.g., `customize_color_control_export`, `customize_text_control_update`). These allow you to hook into specific control behavior.

**Filters:**

- **`customize_dynamic_setting_args`:** This filter allows you to modify the arguments for dynamically generated settings based on custom controls.
- **`customize_option_name`:** This filter allows you to modify the option name used to store customizer setting data (primarily for `type => 'option'` settings).
- **`customizer_enqueue_scripts`:** This filter allows you to modify the scripts enqueued for the customizer.
- **`sanitize_option_{$option_name}`:** This filter allows you to sanitize the value of a customizer setting before it's saved (the actual filter name depends on the specific option name).
- **Many specific filters** exist for individual control types (e.g., `customize_post_title_partial_args`, `customize_control_class`). These allow you to modify the behavior of specific control types.

**Remember:** These are general categories. The specific available actions and filters depend on the WordPress version and any custom code interacting with the Customizer API.

For detailed information and a complete list, it's recommended to refer to the WordPress documentation on the Customizer API [https://codex.wordpress.org/Main_Page](https://codex.wordpress.org/Main_Page) and explore the available functions (`add_action`, `add_filter`) used to hook into these points.
