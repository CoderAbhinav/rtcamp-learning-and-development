# What is decoupled CMS ?
A decoupled CMS is a content management system that has uncoupled the front-end delivery system from the back-end business module.

So basically the headless one is when your CMS is **just a backend**, while the decoupled one is when there's an option to add your own frontend framework to the existing CMS.

# Decoupled CMS: Pros & Cons
1. Flexibility to use frameworks as they arrive and as browser change.
2. Easier to access third-party software and integrate into solutions within your own tech stack
3. Fewer dependencies on IT
4. Enables omnichannel delivery
5. Updates affects the CMS only, not the frontend.
6. Infrastructure flexibility, allows you to use CDNs
